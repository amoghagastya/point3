The launch of our unforgettable citrus fragrance was the true beginning of our hotel partnerships which, until this day, sees our products in five-star hotels across the globe.\n\nIn 2018, we partnered with master perfumer Beverley Bayne, a close friend of Michael Pickthall, to reinvent our Orange and Bergamot Collection. Our aim was to modernise this fragrance with contemporary ingredients whilst remaining true to Michaels original vision. In 2019 we once again sought Beverley\u2019s creative expertise as we launched our very first collection of Eau de Parfum.\n\nBeverley revisited the original inspiration for our iconic collection and staying true to the very heart of the fragrance, she selected a signature note of petitgrain. Petitgrain is steam distilled and extracted from the leaves and bark of the bitter orange tree. It takes around five hundred to six hundred kilograms of leaves to yield just one kilogram of petitgrain. It adds a fresh, green woodiness and entwines beautifully with the other orange tree elements, bringing depth and radiance to a classic collection.\n\nBeverley describes our Orange and Bergamot Collection as a celebration of joy and energy with its enduringly happy aroma and true cult following, we couldn\u2019t agree more.", "57": "Collection: Heavenly Gingerlily; Description: Heavenly Gingerlily is our 6th bestselling Molton Brown Icon.\n\nBlack sands slip into a crystal-clear lagoon.

Did you know, this collection now includes an Eau de Parfum and Eau de Toilette, do you have 5 minutes to try it for yourself?\"\n\n(If your customer is male, keep it simple and introduce the fragrance as an aftershave)\n\n\n\nSimply asking your customer if they have a few minutes to try a product on their skin could result in them actually spending more time with you and increases the chances of them making a purchase!\n\nIf they don't have the time, this is when you can use one of your Bounce Back Invitations to invite them in again when they have more time to indulge.\n\n\"I need some help\"\nThese are fantastic customers!\n\nAs they have expressed that they need some help or advice from you, they are generally more willing to spend time experiencing the products and listening to what you have to tell them.\n\nThis is the perfect time to utilise the Universal Profiling Questions!\n\nOnce you have established their needs using our UPQ's, ask the customer, \"Why not take the opportunity to indulge in a decadent Hand & Arm Massage?

Other times they might be browsing to get gift ideas for themselves or others, but one fact remains, they have walked into your store for a reason. Don't miss a potential sales opportunity!\n\nThis is another opportunity to engage with a Universal Profiler Question such as\n\n\"What do you know about Molton Brown?\"\n\nThis opens up the doors of possibility to find out if they have used and experienced our products before.

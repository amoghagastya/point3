The pepper plant is a  vigorous vine with small green flowers grouped in long clusters, which give way to fleshy fruits of varying colours depending on maturity.\n\n\nBlack pepper, as we recognise it, is the full mature peppercorn, picked when tinged with red.  Several days of sun drying transforms these fleshy berries into shrivelled black kernels with a strong, spicy aroma.

The ingredient Jacques selected was myrtle pepper.

Fizzy. Tempting\n\nVIDEO TRANSCRIPT\n\nInspired by the sweetness of a crisp summer tart, our Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is a fizzy, tempting fragrance which symbolises the very essence of sharp Yorkshire rhubarb. Procured from January to late March, forced rhubarb is grown in the dark in the wonderfully named Rhubarb Triangle in Yorkshire.\n\nRhubarb is so beloved of northern gardens because the cool damp conditions produce the sweetest, most succulent storks. Whether baked into a mouth-watering dessert or simply dipped in sugar, rhubarb has a distinctively cheerful appearance and taste.\n\nOur Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is the creation of senior perfumer Vanessa Prudent. Born in Normandy, Vanessa discovered an early passion for fragrance through nature. She has had the pleasure of travelling across the world and this is where she has found her biggest inspiration. Discovering new places evokes a curiosity, an emotion she uses in her perfumery.\n\nUsing rhubarb sourced from the luscious gardens of the Yorkshire Triangle, Vanessa began crafting an irresistible, floral fruity fragrance which would soon become a favourite of all who experienced it. Our Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is a true floral fruity.\n\nRhubarb spikes a bitter top note as zesty fruits fizz with a citrus twist. These contrast with the sweetness of spun sugar in the base. Our gentle rose extract and vanilla bring to life the buttery pastry of a dessert.", "60": "Title: Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel; Description: Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel is a true Molton Brown Icon.\n\nCoastal.

Blue cypress oil, sometimes referred to as blue gold, is similar to sandalwood oil and vetiver oil with long lasting, warm, woody base notes, and earthy tones. It combines well with lavender, lemon mrytle, citrus, and floral oils.\n\nOur Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Collection is the creation of senior perfumer Carla Chabert, the daughter of world-renowned master perfumer, Jacques Chabert. Her personal love affair with fragrance began as a child after she attended a client\u2019s house with her mother. This hugely resonated with her, remembering the scents, textures, and perfume bottles of that particular meeting with deep affection.\n\nUsing a combination of blue cypress oil, marine notes, and cardamom, to name a few, Carla began crafting an uplifting, compelling fragrance which would soon gain iconic status. Just two years on from the launch of our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Collection, we once again requested Carla\u2019s expert nose as we began the journey to creating our very first Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Eau de Parfum.\n\nFor Carla, the ingredient that was going to truly elevate our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Eau de Parfum was the noble cardamom. Whilst cardamom is not a new addition to this collection, a heavy dose enhances the depth of the fragrance, highlighting the freshness on the top to add strength and vibrancy. For Carla, this overdose of cardamom was an instinctive choice and one which truly elevates our Eau de Parfum to a salt sprayed collision of ingredients.", "61": "Title: Icons Quiz; Description: The Discovery Guide Icons Quiz\n\n\nCongratulations on completing the Icon section of this training module.\n\n\n\nLet's test your knowledge with one final, fun game!\n\nThere are 3 rounds.\n\nWork through them all to earn your total score.\n\nSome questions will give you a chance to win badges too!\n\n\n\nReady?", "62": "Title: Heavenly Gingerlily Collection Sheet; Description: Heavenly Gingerlily Exotic.

You may have a delivery to process or an unexpected visit from your Area Manager\n\nBut remember...\nThe Customer Comes First.\n\nIf a customer has booked in for an experience, ensure that everything is done in your control to stay engaged with them, build rapport and continue to stay connected to ensure they get the most from the service you are conducting.\n\nWe do not want our customers to feel like they are getting in the way!\n\n\nTop Tips\nCustomers love to learn something new - whether that is a technique that they can perform themselves at home or learning something fascinating about our heritage.\nThis is the difference between a scripted service and a personal service - share your top tips with your customers during a Hand & Arm massage using the edutainment tools as your reference.\n\n\nNow that you have seen some examples of things to consider to deliver a fantastic lasting impression with your customers...\n\n\nWhat other ways can you create a fantastic Lasting Impression?\nThink about other ways you believe you can create a great lasting impression with your customers:\n\n\n\n", "81": "Title: Hand & Arm Massages First Impressions; Description: First Impressions\nMenu\nHand & Arm Massage - First Impressions\nWhether your customer is a new or regular Molton Brown shopper, offering them a Hand & Arm Massage is an excellent way to establish rapport and a fantastic first impression.\n\nDid you know?\nTouch creates symbolic connections between people and products, and between buyers and sellers.\n\nPhysically holding products can create a sense of psychological ownership, driving must-have purchase decisions!\n\nThere are various customer types that you will encounter on any given day.\n\nWe have identified four common customer types and how you can offer both a walk in and bookable/elevated Hand & Arm massage to them.\n\nClick on each image below to learn more:\n\n\n\"I know what I want\"\nJust because this customer says they know what they want - doesn't mean they wouldn't be interested in trying a product on their skin, or experiencing other collections they might enjoy.\n\nThis customer type can sometimes come across quite dismissive - Perhaps it could be because of time constraints or because they have been sent in to purchase a product for someone else.\n\nA good way to get around this is to start the conversation with some of the words below:\n\n\"I can see...\"\n\n\"Did you know...\"\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\"I can see you are stocking up on our Re-charge Black Pepper B&SG. Did you know, this collection now includes an Eau de Parfum and Eau de Toilette, do you have 5 minutes to try it for yourself?\"\n\n(If your customer is male, keep it simple and introduce the fragrance as an aftershave)\n\n\n\nSimply asking your customer if they have a few minutes to try a product on their skin could result in them actually spending more time with you and increases the chances of them making a purchase!\n\nIf they don't have the time, this is when you can use one of your Bounce Back Invitations to invite them in again when they have more time to indulge.\n\n\"I need some help\"\nThese are fantastic customers!\n\nAs they have expressed that they need some help or advice from you, they are generally more willing to spend time experiencing the products and listening to what you have to tell them.\n\nThis is the perfect time to utilise the Universal Profiling Questions!\n\nOnce you have established their needs using our UPQ's, ask the customer, \"Why not take the opportunity to indulge in a decadent Hand & Arm Massage? It is the perfect way to experience our products\"\n\nListen closely to any exciting event opportunities a customer might drop into conversation such as upcoming birthday's, weddings etc. as you could potentially host a bespoke VIP event for this customer and boost your KPI's!\n\n\"I'm just browsing\"\nBrowsing customers can generally come across as quite abrupt and dismissive towards you.\n\nSometimes a customer is browsing just to pass time whilst they are waiting for somebody or something. Other times they might be browsing to get gift ideas for themselves or others, but one fact remains, they have walked into your store for a reason. Don't miss a potential sales opportunity!\n\nThis is another opportunity to engage with a Universal Profiler Question such as\n\n\"What do you know about Molton Brown?\"\n\nThis opens up the doors of possibility to find out if they have used and experienced our products before. Why not say: \"Just to let you know I am available to deliver a Hand & Arm Massage today and introduce you to our Molton Brown fragrance collections and their benefits\"\n\n\"I'd like a fully immersive experience\"\nFantastic!\n\nThese customers are fanatics about Molton Brown and would probably be part of your team if they could! They have a wealth of knowledge of past and current collections and love nothing more than getting to be amongst the first to experience and buy new collections.\n\nFully immersive customers make themselves known by taking products to the basins to try, using the fragrance testers and usually ask about our services.\n\nInvite these customers to enjoy an elevated Hand & Arm Massage if they have the time - highlighting that they have been significantly elevated.\n\nAs these customers love to feel extra-special, why not handwrite them an invitation to an upcoming store event or an elevated Fragrance Consultation?\n\n\n\nSetting the scene means to create the conditions in which something can happen.\n\nIt is crucial to creating a great First Impression for your customers, whether it is a quick 5-10 minute Hand & Arm Massage or a bookable/elevated fully immersive experience.\n\nEnsuring we are fully prepared for the day will ensure smooth service for the customer and yourself!\n\nFollow the steps below to setting the scene:\n\nTesters\n\n\n\nAre your product testers suitably full for use?\n\nThere is nothing worse than trying to showcase a product that is nearly empty!\n\nMake sure all testers are ready to be used by your team and customers at the start of each day.\n\nIf another tester needs to be created, speak to a member of management.\n\n\n\n\n\nWater & Basins\n\n\n\nAt the start of each day, ensure that there is hot water running to the basin sinks*.\n\nIf not, raise this with a manager to ensure it is fixed.\n\nIf your basins do not have hot water, not to worry - half fill them with cold water and mix with warm water from the taps back of house.\n\nRemember to run taps for 5 minutes each day to eliminate the potential of legionella.\n\n*Only applicable to stores with basins.\n\n\nTowels\n\n\n\nWhether you are using paper napkin towels or premium cotton towels, ensure that you have enough in stock and laundered ready for use each day.\n\nTowels should look and feel luxurious - even paper napkins.\n\nIf you need more paper napkins, please speak to your manager who will be able to order more.\n\n\n\nRefreshments\n\n\n\nIf you are offering your customers a refreshment, ensure that you have the drink available to serve them and that it is chilled - there is nothing worse than warm bubbly!\n\nRemember to ask your customer if they have any dietary requirements so that you can check for them on the ingredients on the side of the bottle.\n\nUsually, most customers are quite content with a glass of still or sparkling water, or even a cup of coffee.\n\nConsider your staff in store - can you leave the shop floor for several minutes to fetch a cup of coffee? Only offer what is feasible for a seamless customer experience.\n\n\n\nTechniques\n\n\n\nFinally, you need to ensure that you have practiced and are confident in the techniques used to differentiate between a walk-in Hand & Arm Massage to those used in a bookable/elevated experience.\n\nWe want you to feel positive about carrying out every Molton Brown Service Signature with your customers.\n\nIf after this module you still feel you require additional support, speak to your manager who will guide you through the techniques.\n\n\nBefore you begin your Hand & Arm Massage, walk your customer through the collections asking them a series of Universal Profiler Questions to identify their needs. Through this you can determine which collections to introduce and use whilst carrying out the Hand & Arm Massage.\n\nClick each button below to learn about other ways to help set the scene:\n\nPrepare the Hub\n\n\n\nOnce you have selected the products with your customer, ensure that they are open and ready to be used throughout the service.\n\nTop tip: Position the products in a line in the order you are going to apply them to your customers skin.\n\nEnsure you have a full supply of paper towels to use. Be prepared and unfold two paper towels before you start the service\n\n\nFragrance Arc\n\n\n\nBefore you begin delivering the Hand & Arm Massage with your customer, Let them know you are going to place a towel over their lap for protection.\n\nSpray an arc of the chosen Eau de Parfum or Eau de Toilette in a halo above the hub. This will gently scent the space and fully immerse yourself and the customer in olfactive bliss.\n\n\nJewellery\n\n\n\nIf you or your customer are wearing jewellery such as rings or bracelets, we do advise that you politely ask them to be removed.\n\nProduct such as the body polisher can get caught in any grooves and you could catch the palm of your hands on any sharp edges.\n\nSuggest to your customer that they place their items on a napkin in front of them to keep a close eye on, or of course, they can put their belongings in their bag for safe-keeping.\n\nIf you are wearing rings, store them safely until after the service is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "82": "Title: Hand & Arm Massages; Description: Hand & Arm Massages\nMenu\nHand & Arm Massages\nAs one of our Signature Services, our luxurious Hand & Arm Massages are a wonderful way for our customers to fully experience the benefits of our products whilst being fully pampered in the olfactive world of Molton Brown.\n\n\n\n\nThe Services\nMenu\nWhat are the Hand & Arm Massage Services?\nWe can offer our customers the opportunity to experience Molton Brown products during an express 5-10 minute Hand & Arm Massage or indulge them further with a fully immersive 15-20 minute experience.\n\nClick on each image below for a brief overview of each service:\n\nWalk In\n\nYou will be most familiar with Walk In customers and engaging with them already.\n\n\n\nNow you can invite them to experience our products and potentially find new favourites as we guide them through an indulgent ritual whilst explaining the benefits behind each one.\n\n\n\nWalk In consultations should last between 5 and 10 minutes and are an opportunity to show a selection of at least 3 products.\n\n\n\nYou will learn more about this service and the techniques very soon!\n\n\nBookable/Elevated\n\n\n\nThrough a Bookable/Elevated Hand & Arm Massage experience, our customers can indulge in a moment of 'Me Time' as they learn about our collections and products.

The majority of our lightbulbs are now energy saving LED, although there are some areas within our manufacturing plant which we are in the process of converting.\n\u2022 We optimise our manufacturing schedules to provide greater continuity in the production runs; to reduce the need to start/ stop the manufacturing or filling lines. This helps to save energy and water used in the sanitisation process required between each new run. \n\nPRINTING\n\u2022 We have designated printers on each of our office floors that centralises all printing needs. Employees are reminded only to print documents that are absolutely essential to have in a hard copy. All printers have a default setting of printing on both sides to reduce paper waste.\n\nOFFICES & STORES\nOFFICES & STORES\nPRINTING\n\u2022 We purchase electricity for our Manufacturing Facility, Green Street offices and our Stores from renewable sources only (wind, solar and tidal). This means that with the exception of our heating (currently diesel and gasoline) all our energy is green. At this time the electricity supplied to our Shaftesbury Avenue office is sourced via the Service Charge for the building. Therefore we cannot confirm if this is from a Green Energy source at this time.\n\u2022 We have Zip Hydrotapsin our kitchen facilities, providing our employees with instant boiling and chilled water. This replaces the need to re-boiling kettles and reduces plastic waste from the previous water cooler unit refills.\n\nRespect Planet Boundaries\n\nOUR OFFICES\nRECYCLING & WASTE\nKITCHEN\n\nOur employees are provided with crockery and cutlery, as well as dishwashers in the kitchen areas to prevent the use of single use plastics. Many of our employees opt to bring in their own lunch using reusable pots from home\n\nWASTE\nWe are expected to actively separate waste in clearly labelled rubbish bins, including paper, food, plastics and cardboard, collected and recycled by a third party waste management company. Obsolete electronic waste including computer equipment, TVs, printers etc. are all recycled, although we are investigating donation programs as an alternative.\n\nPRINTING\nWe use recycled paper for our offices, however we are looking at alternative options for our current premium grade paper used for compliments slips and letterheads - currently not from recycled sources. Used printer toners and ink cartridges are recycled post use.\n\nCLEANING\nWe use non harmful and specialised cleaning products to sanitise equipment between each production run and at the end of the shift, which reduces the amount of water required.\n\nRespect Planet Boundaries\nOUR MANUFATURING FACILITY\nRECYCLING & WASTE\n\nWe set annual targets to reduce manufacturing waste through efficiencies in planning and processes, with the overall objective of reaching zero. We have an inhouse team who are working on a proposal to have the separation process on site although at moment we are limited on the space that we have and where we would store the recycled wate\n\nIt is impossible to eradicate waste bulk product an  although this is a very low volume for us we do recycle our liquid waste using a third party. They separate the water from any solids (from our lotions for example), generating electricity in the process\n\nCardboard waste from the Manufacturing Facility such as corrugates/ packaging is compressed in-house prior to sending it to a 3rd party recycling plant\n\nWe use non harmful and specialised cleaning products to sanitise equipment between each production run and at the end of the shift, which reduces the\namount of water required\n\n0ur \u201cReturn,\nRecycle, Reward\u201d\nProject will be piloted across some of our Stores and withi selected Hotel partners\n\nRespect Planet Boundaries\nOUR OFFICES AND MANUFATURING FACILITY\nREDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nWe have targets every year to continuously reduce our green house gas generation. There have been vast improvements related to optimisation of manufacturing schedules and improved cleaning processes which are helping us on that journey Although all of our energy is from carbon free sources, we have to use fuel to generate heat for the production of some of our products and heating of our offices. We are working on proposals to eliminate this requirement. \n\nOur transportation is handled by third party courier companies who are working on their own initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. It is difficult to overcome the need to fuel the vehicles. That said, we look at combining journeys all the time, to make every journey count We opt for sea freight to supply our global business, in preference to air freight wherever possible Our manufacturing plant is located in a rural area on a small industrial estate which does not have catering facilities on site. To prevent employees having to travel individually to get food, we have a family run local bakery which visits all the businesses on the Green Street (Elsenham) site\n\nWe now manufacture Street (Elsenham) site two of our shampoos using cold mix processes, replacing hot mix which eliminates the need to heat the mixing vessels. We are looking at moving to this way of manufacturing across other product formats\n\nOUR OFFICES AND MANUFATURING FACILITY\nREDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT\nONLINE COMMUNICATION\nWe provide conference calls with screen share facilities across all employee PCs/ Laptops to prevent unnecessary physical travel \u2013 this also allows us to keep in touch with our global colleagues on a regular basis.\n\nCAR SHARE\nWe encourage our employees to car share where feasible \u2013 this works well at our manufacturing plant where many of our employees live in the same local areas.\n\nCYCLE TO WORK\nWe offer a ride to work scheme available to all\nemployees, providing them with discount for\npurchasing of a bike.\n\nRespect Planet Boundaries\nOUR STORES\nREDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT\nWe promote sustainability across our retail estate wherever possible.

Having reviewed our Gifting Proposition we still want to provide customers with an elevated Gifting offer. However, we do not want to over package our products, which is why we have removed the duo box from our Gifting Offer.\n\nIs it necessary to have so much tissue paper? We have worked to use the minimum amount of tissue paper, only a couple of sheets per box or bag. Our tissue paper is recyclable, biodegradable and compostable. You can dispose of the tissue in your food or green waste.\n\nWhat dyes are used on the boxes and bag \u2013 are these environmentally friendly? The dyes used on our boxes and bag are environmentally friendly.\n\nAre you not worried about sustainability? Light years ahead of our time, sustainability has been always been at the heart of Molton Brown. Our founders always used packaging which could be recycled easily and were among the first to be against animal testing. Today, we strongly believe Luxury and Sustainability go hand in hand, which is why this new Gifting Offer uses 15 tons less material than our previous packaging. In addition, our teams are working very hard to make this packaging even more sustainable for the future. \n\nDo you need to use plastic bags to wrap you candles/ aroma reeds/ Christmas gift boxes? Is the wrapper recyclable? To ensure your products arrive to you in pristine condition, we aim to package products carefully and securely to prevent marking or scuffing on your products. The plastic wrapping is not recyclable. The use of the plastic wrapping is currently under review\n\nAre the new boxes and bags recyclable? Our boxes are recyclable but you need to remove the magnet from the front of the box first. All of our bags are recyclable except the handles, which can be removed. We would advise you to re-use our boxes and bags as a beautiful storage solution rather than recycling.\n\nAre the ribbons recyclable? Unfortunately, at this stage our ribbons are not recyclable. We would advise you to re-use our beautiful ribbons as an adornment to any gift. We are looking at an alternative for the future. \n\nWhy has the print on the boxes/tissue paper changed? As we aim to refine our Brand Experience to its very best, we have reworked our Gifting Boxes\nto align them with the look and feel of our new Fragrance Packaging. This still incorporates our signature Molton Brown Compass pattern.\n\nWhy have you changed the duo box? You are a luxury brand; I expect the old style. Having reviewed our Gifting Proposition we still want to provide customers with elevated Gifting offer. However, we do not want to over package our products, which is why we have removed the duo box from our Gifting Offer\n\nWhat elements of Molton Brown\u2019s gift wrap\nmaterials are recyclable?\n- Boxes (please remove the magnet before recycling)\n- Bags (please remove handles before recycling)\n- Tissue Paper\n- Tissue paper stickers\n- The adhesive tape on gift boxes\n\nWhy have you changed for a box and lid to a magnet lock box?\nIn line with current trends we have updated the design of our gift boxes to a magnet close.\n\nI want to add something else into my bag, but the sticker is already closed?

The roses were said to have been spread across the Earth to protect these spirits\u2019 homeland.\nIt is also considered an affirmation stone.

From Hand & Arm massage techniques to fragrance consultations we have ensured these experiences are memorable and encourage Customer Lifetime Value.\n\nClick on each icon below to learn more about some of the elevated changes:\n\nHand & Arm Massages\nWe have completely revamped our Hand & Arm Massages which have been adapted for both time-conscious walk-in customers and those looking for an indulgent treat via a bookable service.\n\nFor those of you who have been with Molton Brown for a while, you will undoubtedly notice some of the different ways in which we have elevated these experiences.\n\nFragrance Consultations\nAs part of our mission to be recognised as a fragrance first retailer, we have reviewed our current fragrance consultation proposition and re-worked it to include a blend of education and entertainment to enhance the customers experience. We have also provided YOU with some exciting tools to achieve this.\n\nEdutainment\nWhat is Edutainment?\n\nEdutainment is a method to entertain whilst educating our customers on our products, our brand and provides them with a fully immersive experience that showcases your skills and your knowledge of Molton Brown.\n\nWe have created a set of tools covering everything from our heritage, sustainability credentials, iconic products and even how the sense of smell works. Each tool is broken down into small points to enable bite size learning.\n\nWe know that our customers love to experience our products but also learn about them too - remember, it is the benefits of a product that helps to sell it!\n\nEvents\nIn-store events and activities are incredibly important to encourage customer interaction, sales growth and customer life time value.\n\nWe have in the past focused on hosting events only when new products are released. To relinquish our dependence on new collections, we have reviewed our eventing proposition so that you are empowered to host an event with any iconic collection, whenever you choose.\n\nWhy do I need to know about the elevated Service Signatures?\nAs an employee of Molton Brown, it is an essential part of your job to deliver the FLOW philosophy with every customer that walks into your store.\n\nThis includes conducting Hand & Arm Massages and Fragrance Consultations.\n\nThis helps to build brand trust and loyalty and ensures that we are continually recognised as a luxury brand.\n\nClick on each image below to learn more about why you need to actively promote the Molton Brown Service Signatures:\n\nLuxury Experience\n\nOffering your customer the opportunity to enjoy an indulgent hand & arm massage to learn about and experience our products is the pinnacle of luxury service.\n\n\nConsistent Service\n\nWe want to ensure that whether a customer walks into one of our stand alone stores, an outlet or even a wholesale door, the experiences delivered are as consistent in technique as possible.\n\n\n\nThis will also help you build your confidence in delivering the various techniques required for each of the services.\n\n\nKPIs\nOf course, whilst offering luxurious services to our customers to enjoy, our products help to set us apart from some of our competitors - they are also a sales technique to help boost our KPIs.\n\n\n\nOnce a customer gets to feel and experience the product on their skin, they have made a physical connection to the product and begin to desire them once they understand the benefits and value of each product used.\n\n\n", "126": "Title: Orange & Bergamot: Icon; Description: What will I learn\nelcome to the Orange & Bergamot Campaign.\n\n \n\nThroughout this module you will discover the new editions to the Orange & Bergamot collection.\n\n \n\nWe will revisit the entire collection giving you an insight into the inspiration behind the collection and how you can use FLOW to really WOW! your customer.\n\n \n\nSo what will you learn?\n\nMeet the Perfumer\nFragrance Inspiration\nFirst Impressions\nLast Impressions\nEliminating the Ouches\nFocus on the WOW!\n \n\nPlease remember, when putting all your knowledge into practise you follow the recommendations regarding Covid-19 set out in the Retail Operations Guidleines and FLOW - Adapting our Philosophy documents.\n\n \n\n \n\nLet's get started....\n\nLondon Via Seville - Orange & Bergamot\n\nNaranja orbs light winding calles like fragrant lanterns.

Attracted to working in perfume, he began to study chemistry. In 1971, he was one of the five students at ISIPCA, a perfumery school that had just opened. The school year was only just over when he joined Dana.\n\n \n\nWhen the company closed in 1979, he went to work for Oril Fontarome.  It was in 1982 that the doors really opened for him when he joined Takasago, a new name in the European world of fragrances, with Michel Almairac and Pierre Bourdon at the helm on the creative side of the business.\n\n \n\nIt was a fabulous period for Philippe Bousseton, who spent his time juggling between toiletries and perfumes. He got so used to it that it actually became his philosophy of life, one in which he finds pride, humility and joy.\n\nWhat was the inspiration behind Immersive Samphire & Eucalyptus?\n\nOur first fragrance brings together two Seabourn ports which are over 5000 miles apart.\n\n \n\nThe first stop \u2013 the French Atlantic coast. This beautiful coastline is home to a long seafaring tradition and gives us our first ingredient, Samphire.\n\n \n\nOur second stop \u2013 China.\n\nThe coastal areas of Beijing gives us our second ingredient, Eucalyptus.\n\nPerfumer - Heidrun Harder\n\nWe have partnered with Heidrun Harder to create our Inspiring Basil & Vetiver Collection.

He taught us that good fortune is given only to those who work diligently and behave with integrity. We will always choose the path of integrity, even when it is not easy.\n\nWe treat everyone with respect, fairness, and empathy and work with sincerity of purpose.

If we fail, we reflect, learn, try again, and improve.\nWe persist", "157": "Title: CEO Message; Description: Rapidly Transforming into the New, Strong and Agile Kao\n\nThe world today continues to experience great turmoil. Rising geopolitical tensions are fueling divisions among people, the pandemic is still with us, and environmental problems are increasing in severity. On the other hand, economic activities are necessary for people to continue living their lives. There have been long-running debates on how to balance human life and the economy, the environment and the economy, and so on. It is incumbent upon us to find this balance in the world in the 21st century. We have set our purpose as \"to realize a Kirei World in which all life lives in harmony,\" and our vision as \"protecting future lives\" and \"sustainability as the only path\" in our Mid-Term Plan K25 in light of the tumultuous times that we are in. We have been driving dual-track reforms using two concepts: Reborn Kao to revitalize our existing business, and Another Kao to create new business.\n\nThe first year of K25 was a turbulent one. We must accelerate our business transformation if we want to get back on a path to grow our business despite the impact from external factors such as the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and hikes in raw material prices.\nBased on the awareness of these issues, the immediate priority to deliver on the Reborn Kao plan is to implement manufacturing and marketing reforms. To bring maximum value with minimum waste, we have been accelerating ESG-driven Yoki-Monozukuri. We will be making dynamic investments in category-leading brands and shift to loyalty marketing with a focus on connecting with customers. Next, regarding globalization, we will avoid fierce competition by ensuring we offer \"only one\" value to our customers and will also move toward local production and consumption model, grounded on local production. Another initiative is significant reform for highly profitable business. We have separated our business into three domains to clarify our direction for investment. The domains are Stable Earnings, which relies on high-margin category leading businesses to support the business base, Growth Drivers to accelerate our growth through targeted investment, and Business Transformation to press on by transforming business models to maintain and increase profitability.\nAnother Kao focuses on themes that we have not done, or have not been able to do, in the past. Our goal in this is stated in our Commitment to the Future. In Precision Life Care, which is included in the Commitment, we have launched specific initiatives. The business model mobilizes our deep expertise in monitoring technologies and allows us to deliver precise and customizable solutions. We have also started utilizing the Virtual Human Body Generative Model, which can be versatilely applied to meet diverse needs by estimating correlations. We will roll them out to various areas through collaboration with partners who share the same aspiration.\n\nWe will transform our manufacturing from an approach driven by consumption to one where resources are circulated. This represents a transition from a linear economic model on units and volumes to a circular economy based on quality and human connections. We will remain focused on developing a growing circular business model. We expect to enact business reforms in FY2022 amid the challenging business environment. We view the current turbulence as an opportunity to reform and are fully committed to transform rapidly into the new, stronger and more agile Kao, maximizing the capability of all our group employees.\n\nJuly 2022\n\n\n\nYoshihiro Hasebe\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nKao Corporation", "159": "Title: Basic Views and Features; Description: Achieving higher levels of sound and transparent corporate management\n\nBasic Views\n\nIn order to sustainably enhance corporate value over the long term while working to realize a Kirei World in which all life lives in harmony, which is our purpose, and to become an essential company in a sustainable world, as raised in K25, Kao positions corporate governance as a top-priority management issue and continuously strengthens governance in both systems and operations. Kao's corporate governance is a framework for transparent, fair, prompt and decisive decision-making. It takes into account the perspectives of all stakeholders and responds in a timely and appropriate manner to changes that are increasingly diverse, complex, and difficult to predict so that we can contribute to society and continuously enhance corporate value. The foundations of our efforts to achieve this are establishing and operating the necessary management structures and internal control systems, implementing the necessary measures in a timely manner, and demonstrating accountability. In addition, we work to understand social trends at all times and actively engage in dialogue with stakeholders to review the status of corporate governance from time to time and implement appropriate and necessary countermeasures and improvements.\n\nFeatures of Kao's Corporate Governance\n\nTo realize a Kirei World in which all life lives in harmony\nWe position the establishment of effective corporate governance systems as the foundation and a driver for achieving our purpose to realize a Kirei World in which all life lives in harmony.\n\nIntegrity as the only choice\nWe practice corporate governance that places our corporate philosophy, the Kao Way, at the core of our business management, and with a consistent focus on Integrity as the only choice, which is one of values of the Kao Way. Employees work together based on mutual respect and fairness, bring an attitude of sincerity and diligence, and conduct themselves lawfully and ethically, and by so doing we are able to maintain the support and trust of all stakeholders and engage in sound and honest business activities.\n\nInnovation for today and tomorrow\nWe have pursued creation of the most optimal structure to respond to changes in the business environment as well as social demands. At the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held in March 2022, we appointed nine Directors, including one American Director and two female Directors, in order to ensure greater diversity on the Board of Directors and to further strengthen oversight in decision-making from the ESG management and global perspectives that Kao seeks. We are working to enhance corporate value by reviewing our systems and operations to achieve a higher level of corporate governance.\n\nUse of outside executives\nWe have put in place a system of governance able to maintain a high degree of objectivity, including making 7 of the 14 members of the Board of Directors/Audit & Supervisory Board Members independent and outside members and having an Outside Director serve as Chairperson of the Board of Directors, to ensure that the Board of Directors is able to appropriately perform management oversight. Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members are designated with priority placed on their independence as well as their expertise and high-level insight. They oversee and audit planning and execution of business strategy and the like from their diverse viewpoints, facilitating effective and judicious decision-making.\n\nStrengthening internal control\nThe Internal Control Committee leads discussions on compliance, risk and crisis management, and related topics across the Kao Group to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our business processes, ensure the credibility of our financial reporting, comply with laws and regulations in our business activities, and preserve our assets, and we are strengthening internal control throughout the Kao Group.\n\nThe Path toward Strengthened Governance\nWe have also practiced Innovation, which is one of Values of the Kao Way, in the area of corporate governance from an early stage. We have pursued creation of the most optimal structure to respond to changes in the business environment as well as social demands, and will continue to take steps to reform our governance.\n\nStandards for Independence of Outside Directors/Audit & Supervisory Board Members\nKao has established the \"Standards for Independence of Outside Directors/Audit & Supervisory Board Members of Kao Corporation\" to clarify the standards for independence of an outside director/Audit & Supervisory Board Member.\n\nKao Group Tax Policy\nThe Kao Group has implemented a \"Tax Policy\" aiming to improve its tax governance framework, reflecting the group's tax code of conduct and its consistent standards for approaching tax matters throughout the group.\n\nThe publication of this strategy statement is regarded as satisfying the duty under Paragraph 16(2), Schedule 19, Finance Act 2016 in UK.", "160": "Title: Messages from Outside Directors and an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member; Description: I provide objective evaluations of Kao's initiatives and support executives in taking an aggressive approach to challenges.\n\nOsamu Shinobe\nOutside Director\nChairperson of the Board of Directors\n\nKao began its new mid-term plan, K25, in 2021. As an Outside Director, I would like to closely supervise the plan's implementation and preserve the integrity of its three pillars: Reborn Kao, Another Kao and ESG. In 2022, the key issue will be how Kao will fight in Reborn Kao. Poor earnings in Reborn Kao would make it impossible for Kao to take on substantial challenges in Another Kao. For the Consumer Products Business, how Kao sells its current products in the short-term will be one issue but creating mainstay products and services for the long-term is also important. Kao needs to fundamentally reconsider its sales methods and products from the customer's perspective and also revolutionize its marketing strategy by combining the use of digital transformation with optimal value communication. Kao must develop its businesses outside Japan based on the unique traits of each region rather than treating them as a uniform group. Kao also needs to conduct M&As that align with its growth strategy for business expansion outside Japan.\nThe Board of Directors will have to also vigilantly monitor these activities to ensure they align with ESG perspectives. Kao is at the stage where it can take the next step in its ESG activities, so I would like Kao to work on developing products that will be profitable under ESG criteria and place them on the market as soon as possible.\nI became the Chairperson of the Board of Directors in March 2022. I will continue to evaluate Kao's initiatives objectively as an Independent Outside Director while also supporting executives in taking an aggressive approach to challenges, without being excessively afraid of failure. I am also committed to enhancing corporate value by making the Board of Directors more effective as its chairperson.\n\nI will continue to monitor activities so that Kao can deliver differentiated value with speed.\n\nChiaki Mukai\nOutside Director\n\nEach meeting of the Board of Directors features free and open discussions. In 2021, we had a constructive exchange of opinions as the responsible persons presented the key themes of K25, including initiatives on PR strategies, the Digital Life Platform, and Human Capital Development as well as updates on R&D, which is Kao's driving force. My stance on executives' proposals is always to help get the ball rolling, but I also carefully consider each proposal's feasibility by examining the appropriateness of its timeline for the given objective, risk factors in the global landscape, the public's receptiveness, and the scientific basis for product statements.\nKao offers an extraordinarily broad range of products. In addition to developing each brand individually, Kao should take a step toward showing people how their lives will improve by using all of Kao's products and develop more cross-sector products, as it did with Protect JAPAN and MyKirei by KAO in the U.S. I would like to help Kao showcase their collective strength by using new approaches that only Kao can use. With regards to human capital, Kao is moving in a good direction by increasing diversity and promoting young talent, but still has to increase motivation by revising evaluation criteria and further develop discussions on human capital strategy that is devised by backcasting from an ideal picture. Kao has extremely good seeds. I believe that Kao's future challenges will include being able to quickly convert these seeds into products and get them on the market, as well as sending a clear message to consumers about their differentiated value. As an Outside Director, I will continue to vigilantly monitor Kao's activities while lending a hand to support executives.\n\nI pay close attention to changes brought about by K25 and play a part in conducting appropriate governance for both defensive and offensive objectives.\n\nTakahiro Nakazawa\nOutside Audit & Supervisory Board Member\n\nI have attended every meeting of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board since becoming an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member in 2020. All participants freely engage in lively and substantive discussions at the meetings of the Board of Directors, regardless of whether they are internal or external members, or Directors or Audit & Supervisory Board Members.\nKao's Inside Directors with executive duties listen earnestly to the opinions of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and have processes in place for incorporating the content of our discussions into their management. I believe Kao is thorough in its application of corporate governance, and their willingness to utilize outside perspectives in their management is what makes Kao's Board of Directors function so well.\nAudit & Supervisory Board Members conduct audits of internal controls, which are a part of corporate governance. At each audit site, we conduct audits, interview departments responsible for the second line, and hear how they are responding to current issues, incidents or accidents. We fulfill our role in defensive corporate governance by stopping problems before they start and, when problems actually occur, identifying root causes and thoroughly investigating each problem to prevent recurrence.\nThe content of the 2021 meeting of the Board of Directors was appropriate for being K25's launch year. We heard thorough reports on the progress of Reborn Kao and Another Kao. From 2022 onward, we can anticipate even more changes while pursuing new incarnations of Kao through Reborn Kao and Another Kao. I would like to keep a close eye on changes in risk management and internal controls that are caused by K25's reforms, not only for defensive corporate governance but for offensive as well. As an Audit & Supervisory Board Member, I hope to enhance Kao's corporate value by playing a part in maintaining appropriate corporate governance.\n\n", "161": "Title: Compensation System for Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Executive Officers; Description: Compensation System for Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Executive Officers\n\nThe compensation system for Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Executive Officers is aimed at (1) securing and retaining diverse, outstanding talent so as to establish and enhance competitive advantage, (2) promoting prioritized actions for realizing continuous increases in corporate value and (3) sharing interests in common with shareholders.\nStarting in FY2017, we have introduced a performance-based share incentive plan for our Directors (excluding Outside Directors) and Executive Officers. Serving as a highly transparent and objective remuneration system that is closely linked to company performance, the performance-based share incentive plan aims to increase awareness of contributing to improvements in our financial performance and corporate value over the mid- to long-term.\nRegarding Kao's share incentive plan, in order to promote the vision of \"contributing to an 'enriched sustainable world' and growing the businesses of the company through proactive engagement in ESG activities and investment\" which is one of the goals of K25 that was initiated in FY2021, we have made adjustments to the long-term incentive compensation indicators starting from FY2021.\nAs regards short-term incentive compensation, while the exact percentage varies between the President and Chief Executive Officer, Inside Directors and other Executive Officers, in all cases EVA and consolidated net sales and income are used as the evaluation indicators. EVA, which is a management indicator to which we attach great importance, has been adopted as an evaluation indicator in order to provide motivation for enhancing corporate value through the implementation of long-term strategies that contribute toward the resolution of ESG issues. With regard to the adoption of consolidated net sales and income as evaluation indicators, this represents a goal that is shared with ordinary employees. It provides motivation for realizing profitable growth through day-today business activities, and can help to foster a sense of unity with employees.\n\nSummary of Compensation System for Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Executive Officers\n\nCompensation Structure for Directors\n\nCompensation Paid to Directors in FY2021\n*1 The above numbers of Directors/Audit & Supervisory Board Members include one Audit & Supervisory Board Member who resigned at the conclusion of the 115th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 26, 2021.\n*2 As for the variable portion (performance-linked portion) of the long-term incentive compensation (performance-linked stock compensation), it will be determined after the end of the final year of the five fiscal years from 2021 to 2025, which are covered by the Company's medium-term management plan \"K25\". Therefore, the variable portion (performance-linked portion) shown above is the amount of the allowance for the current fiscal year.\n*3 The maximum amounts of remuneration, etc. are as follows:\n(1) Maximum aggregate amount of remuneration, etc., to be paid to Directors:\nAn annual amount of 630 million yen (as resolved at the 101st Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 28, 2007). The Company had 15 Directors (including two Outside Directors) at the time such resolution was adopted. Such maximum aggregate amount includes the maximum annual amount of 100 million yen to be paid to Outside Directors (as resolved at the 110th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 25, 2016) but does not include the salary amounts, etc. to be paid to Directors who also serve as employees of the Company, for their service as employees. The Company had seven Directors (including three Outside Directors) at the time such resolution was adopted.\nBased on a resolution adopted at the 115th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 26, 2021, the Company has introduced a performance-based share incentive plan for its Directors (excluding Outside Directors) and its Executive Officers, which shall be applicable separately from the maximum aggregate amount of remuneration, etc., for the Directors. Under this share incentive plan, trust money of up to 3.65 billion yen is contributed concerning the fiscal years subject to the Company's mid-term plan (the initial period to be covered being the period of five fiscal years from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025), and the Company's shares are acquired through a trust and are then vested, etc., through the trust, based on the evaluation indicators consisting of growth potential evaluation indicators (such as the degree of growth in overall business sales and profit, etc.), ESG potential evaluation indicators (such as evaluation by external indicators), and management potential evaluation indicators (such as evaluation of management activities by the Company's employees). The Company had four Directors (excluding Outside Directors) at the time such resolution was adopted.\n\n(2) Maximum aggregate amount of remuneration, etc., to be paid to Audit & Supervisory Board Members:\nAn annual amount of 120 million yen (as resolved at the 113th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 26, 2019). The Company had five Audit & Supervisory Board Members (including three Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members) at the time such resolution was adopted.\n\n(3) Aggregate amount of remuneration, etc. paid to Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members by the Company's subsidiaries, etc., other than the aggregate amount of remuneration, etc. paid to Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members:\nRemuneration paid to one Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member for his service as an Audit & Supervisory Board Member of Kao Group Customer Marketing Co., Ltd. was 4 million yen.\n\nCompensation Paid for Individual Directors in FY2021", "162": "Title: Compliance / Integrity; Description: Compliance / Integrity\nActing as an honest, clean and virtuous corporate citizen\nKao Group companies conduct corporate activities as honest, clean and virtuous corporate citizens based on ethical principles and mere compliance with the law while seeking the support of society at large.\n\nThe principle of integrity, passed down from our founder, is one of the core values of our corporate philosophy, the Kao Way.

We aim to develop a scientific understanding of the essential nature of phenomena, and we generate new value through matrix management of product development research and fundamental research.", "167": "Title: Basic Concepts on R&D; Description: R&D Philosophy\nAchieving Consumer and Customer Satisfaction through Innovative Technologies\nThe Kao Way\nimage\n\nKao's corporate philosophy, \"The Kao Way,\" defines Kao's mission as \"to strive with enthusiasm and unity of purpose to enrich people's lives every day, to create the Kirei Life, and to share joy through innovation to create superior value, and to realize a safe and harmonious world for all life\".\n\n\"Kirei\" is not just about appearance. In Japanese, the word \"Kirei\" means cleanliness, order, beauty, and everything in between. It is a value that describes a way of life that seeks to create beauty for oneself, for others, and for the natural world around us.\n\nIn order to realize the Kirei Life, the R&D Division will devote all its efforts to Yoki-Monozukuri, which meets the present and future needs of people, society, and the Earth.\n\"Yoki-Monozukuri\" means deeply understanding the needs and values of consumers and customers, and providing high-value products, brands, technologies, and solutions that truly satisfy consumers and customers around the world.\nIn order to continuously create innovative value, we want to combine the creativity and vitality of all our employees and teams to take on the challenge of new science and technology.\n\nWe will continue to boldly take on the challenges of the future.\n\nResearch Field\nCreating Innovative Products through the Integration of Science and Technology\nKao's research and development activities are characterized by the integration of science and technology spanning a wide variety of fields.\n\nThe overall framework of our business activities is expressed in the slogan, \"Cleanliness, Beauty, and Health Every Day.\" To achieve these goals, our R&D Division creates innovative products by integrating two kinds of research: product development research, which is dedicated to designing and commercializing products that meet consumer needs; and fundamental technology research, which is dedicated to deepening our understanding of the materials, mechanisms, and phenomena we encounter. This integration enables us to create innovative products that can be used by people all over the world.\n\nOur first step in designing a product (our product development research) is to thoroughly understand their lives and needs of our consumers on a global scale. From this starting point, we pursue product design and application technology development that coalesces into products that give people enjoyment and satisfaction.\n\nIn our fundamental technology research, we investigate the truth behind the various phenomena by utilizing advanced science and technology in various fields, including chemistry, physics, and biology. Fundamental technology research plays a crucial role in the development of products with true value.\n\nOur pursuit of Yoki-Monozukuri begins through integration of various research fields such as fat and oil science and surface science, which are the starting points for our businesses and production engineering fields. To this is added consideration of emotional value, as well as research on quality, safety, and environmental compatibility.\n\nProducts with true value cannot be created through work in a single scientific or technical field. Through a cross-industrial and interdisciplinary approach that transcends existing academic frameworks, we pursue new sciences and technologies that can open the door to the future.\n\nManagement\nOperations and Corporate Culture that Encourage Dynamic Exchange of Knowledge\nKao employs a matrix management system that combines business units and functional units. The R&D Division is a functional unit that is divided into two sections, one devoted to product development research and the other to fundamental research. The product development section works through matrix management with business units. Exploiting the strength of this management, we work on new forms of product development and product improvement.\n\nMeanwhile, the fundamental research section conducts scientific and technological research that can be utilized for a variety of products, as well as medium- and long-term research aimed at new business opportunities.\n\nMatrix management is also pursued within the R&D Division between the product development and fundamental research sections. Close ties are maintained with production, quality assurance, and customer communication sections within the company. We also engage in joint research projects with various outside research institutes, universities, and companies. Through such collaboration, knowledge from many different fields can be dynamically shared, and this greatly accelerates our work.\n\nOne way in which our flexible operational structure expresses itself is through the use of a single large laboratory room style. Researchers with different types of expertise in diverse fields work together on the same floor, pursuing their research while engaging in constant conversation, exchange of information, and ideas. This open working environment promotes exchange of knowledge and expertise across fields, inspires new ideas, and encourages cooperation among researchers. This is what gives Kao's R&D Division such tremendous potential.\nBehind this operational system is an ongoing respect for the autonomy of the researchers, who conceive, plan, propose, and implement their own research projects in a free corporate culture.\n\nimage-01\n\nLarge laboratory room where researchers with different expertise work together\n\nGlobal Network\nContributing to People and Diverse Industries around the World\nGlobal Activities\nimage-01\n\nWith Kao's global expansion of business operations, we have vigorously pursued R&D activities in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. We have high regards for the opinions and points of views of our consumers and customers, and we are committed to Yoki-Monozukuri in order to continue to generate products with high added value.\n\nIn the field of consumer products, we continually study changing lifestyles and preferences in different regions, as well as ethnic differences in skin and hair, in order to thoroughly understand our consumers' lifestyles and needs. The knowledge thus acquired is combined with research findings from product development and fundamental research so that we can develop the products that consumers in each region truly desire. In the field of chemical products, we actively develop various products that are based on our unique fundamental technologies throughout the world.\n\nIn global R&D activities, communication is given a high priority. This, of course, includes communication with our consumers, but it also extends to specialists in various fields, regardless of their organization or geographical region. In this way, we create new products with new technologies and add value that is truly universal.\n\n", "168": "Title: Product Development Research; Description: Beauty Care\nimage-02\nIntegrating evidence-based investigation and sensory beauty, and realizing both revolutionary functionality and outstanding quality\nAt Kao, we undertake not only research into skin and hair care, but also research that aims to develop an in-depth understanding of the vital phenomena of the human body.

Cationic technology is still leveraged in Cur\u00e9l products today to help provide a great non-greasy use experience.\n\n- Cur\u00e9l Skincare advertising featured the tagline of \u201cBetter at Ending Dry Skin\u201d to speak to the product efficacy and the better use experience due to the proprietary cationic technology.\n \n\nUSA - 1986 to 1992: Medical Credibility\n- Medical professionals began to see the benefits to using Cur\u00e9l products, and began to recommend Cur\u00e9l products to their patients.\n \n- Cur\u00e9l Skincare started to use the testimonials of doctors and nurses in advertising conveying Cur\u00e9l Skincare as a brand that \u201cEnds Dry Skin Better\u201d\n \n\nUSA - 1993 to 1997: See the Cure\n- In 1993 Bausch & Lomb acquired Cur\u00e9l Skincare from SC Johnson\n \n- Bausch & Lomb moved away from the \u201cEnds Dry Skin Better\u201d messaging\n \n- New communication focused on Cur\u00e9l products as a \u201cCure\u201d\n            o \u201cUntil there\u2019s a cure, there\u2019s Cur\u00e9l\u201d\n            o \u201cSee the Cure in Cur\u00e9l\u201d\n \n- Medical professional testimonials continued to be used with messaging about Cur\u00e9l Skincare being the \u201cbest therapeutic lotion available without a prescription.\u201d\n \n- In 1996, the Caduceus first appeared on Cur\u00e9l product packaging to reinforce the brands efficacy and credentials in caring for dry, damaged skin. \n \n\nJapan - 1988 to 1998: Kao Corporation and Breakthrough Discovery in Skincare\n- At this time Kao Corporation (based in Japan) was independently studying the causes and effects of dry, sensitive skin at a micro-level.\n \n- Through this skincare research, scientists made a category-changing discovery about the structure and make-up of skin and the role that Ceramides, a critical lipid family, play in skin health and its ability to maintain hydration.\n \n- Unfortunately, ceramides are extremely expensive limiting the quantity that is able to be used in skincare products.  With this knowledge, Kao set out to create a proprietary ceramide technology to restore ceramide levels in skin and return damaged skin to health. This technology is known as \u201cAdvanced Ceramide Complex.\u201d This Advanced Ceramide Complex allowed Kao to affordably develop pseudo-ceramides, which in turn would allow them to include higher quantities in products to effectively restore skin\u2019s moisture barrier.\n \n- However, at the time Kao did not own any Skincare brand within which they could use this breakthrough ceramide technology.\n\nUSA - 1998: A Foundation for Technology\n- In 1998 Kao Corporation acquired Cur\u00e9l Skincare from Bausch & Lomb.\n \n- With the acquisition of Cur\u00e9l Skincare, Kao had a well-respected dry, sensitive skincare brand within which they could utilize their breakthrough Advanced Ceramide Complex.\n\nUSA - 1999 to 2010: Meeting the Needs of Dry Skin Sufferers\n- Cur\u00e9l Skincare continued on the mission to correct dry skin-related issues and concerns.\n \n- In 2002, Cur\u00e9l Skincare developed an intensive moisturizing lotion called \u201cExtreme Care.\u201d This moisturizer is now the most popular product in the Cur\u00e9l Skincare portfolio, but is now known as Cur\u00e9l Ultra Healing Lotion. \n \n- Cur\u00e9l Skincare developed and launched Cur\u00e9l Itch Defense Lotion in 2009 to specifically address the needs of people suffering from dry, itchy skin.\n \n\nJapan - 1999 to Present: The Development of Curel Skincare in Japan\n- With the acquisition of Cur\u00e9l Skincare, Kao set about developing a line of products for the Japan market that could leverage the proprietary Advanced Ceramide Complex to care for dry, sensitive skin.\n \n- In 2001, Kao launched a comprehensive line of dry, sensitive skincare products focused on delivering the fundamental solution for dry, sensitive skin exclusively in Japan.\n\n        o The Advanced Ceramide Complex is the cornerstone of this line of products.\n \n- The line is primarily focused on addressing sensitive facial skin with cleansers that will not strip the moisture barrier of precious hydration and moisturizer that deeply hydrate without irritation, but also features a range of products for the body and scalp.\n \n- In 2008, Cur\u00e9l Skincare became the #1 brand for dry, sensitive skin in Japan and has maintained this position every year since.\n \n- In 2012, the Cur\u00e9l Skincare line of products from Japan began expanding throughout Asia.\n \n- Today this line of over 60 products addresses a range of dry, sensitive skin issues and concerns, and is continuing to gain popularity throughout Japan and Asia.\n \n\nUSA - 2016 to Present: Technology Breakthrough\n- Through our ongoing efforts to understand dry skin, Cur\u00e9l Skincare uncovered research about the time when skin is able to absorb the most moisture- while skin is still wet immediately following a shower. This information lead to the development of Cur\u00e9l Hydra Therapy Wet Skin Moisturizer.\n \n- In 2016, Cur\u00e9l Skincare launched Hydra Therapy Wet Skin Moisturizer in the US to provide maximum hydration to those that suffer from dry-skin related issues while also delivering a product consumers will love to use since it leaves the skin deeply hydrated without feeling greasy, heavy, or sticky.\n \n- Today Cur\u00e9l Skincare in the US continues on the mission to End Dry Skin through the development of products that fundamentally restore dry, sensitive skin to health and that people will love to use every day.\n ", "188": "Title: Cur\u00e9l is on a Mission to End Dry Skin; Description: In the United States there are over 30 million people who suffer from dry skin related symptoms such as ashy, flakey, itchy, or cracking skin on a regular and ongoing basis. Unfortunately, much of this suffering is needless. Simply applying a good, quality moisturizer consistently and proactively throughout the year could eliminate these dry skin problems for most people.\n\n    However, the problem is not with the people that have the dry skin, it\u2019s with the people who are making lotions. The problem is that those good, quality moisturizers are frequently miserable to use. They are greasy and sticky. They sit on the skin and don\u2019t absorb quickly, leaving the skin feeling heavy and weighed down. Then, after all that, the moisture doesn\u2019t even last long enough to provide all day relief. How can anyone be expected to use products like that consistently and proactively throughout the year?\n\n    But it\u2019s just dry skin, it\u2019s not that big of a deal! Over time everyone learns how to deal with their own specific skin challenges. If you have a bad knee you know you have to avoid kneeling. If you have sensitive teeth you learn which side of your mouth to eat that bowl of ice cream. And if you have back pain you quickly learn how to move in just the right way to avoid pain.\n\n    We learn how to deal with problems and get on with our life. People who experience consistently dry skin do the exact same thing\u2026 They have learned that they get embarrassed when people see or comment on their dry skin, so they tend to cover up, even in the heat of the summer. They know that their rough hands are a challenge no matter how much greasy lotion they put on, so they will do everything to avoid shaking hands, including avoiding eye contact. And they know that long exposure to biting winter air will leave their skin in bad shape for weeks, so they will avoid spending time outside in the winter including trips to the ice skating rink.\n\n    The problem is that these little adjustments silently rob people with dry skin of valuable connections in their lives. While these minor lifestyle adjustments are essential for staying comfortable, they result in fewer handshakes, less eye contact, and fewer memories with friends and family.\n\n    At Cur\u00e9l Skincare, we believe that connections with others are the most valuable things in life. The challenge with connections is that they are precious and they are fleeting. They are  precious because you can never tell when the tiniest connection will end up completely changing the course of someone\u2019s life. But connections are also fleeting because once the opportunity for a connection has passed it will never happen the same way again.   \n \n    Dry skin is preventing people from fully connecting in their lives\u2026 and this is why Cur\u00e9l Skincare is on a mission to End Dry Skin\u2026 for good.\n\n    At Cur\u00e9l Skincare we believe life has enough obstacles that stand in the way of living your best and most connected life and dry skin doesn\u2019t need to be yet another reason.\n\n    At Cur\u00e9l Skincare, we envision a future where those 30 million people no longer avoid eye contact, handshakes, or events with friends & family. Where a request to go to the beach with friends is met with excitement instead of dread. Where building a snowman with the kids after the first big snowfall is a source of life-long memories instead of lasting regret.\n\n    This is what fuels the work we do at Cur\u00e9l Skincare; helping every last one of these 30 million people permanently correct their dry skin related issues so it will never again stand in the way of a connection that may change their lives.\n\n    To achieve this goal we had to think differently about moisturizers. We understand that the most efficacious moisturizer only works well if people want to use it.  This is why Cur\u00e9l Skincare makes moisturizers with Advanced Ceramide Complex that target the source of dry skin, but equally important we make moisturizers that are really enjoyable to use. Products that are not heavy, greasy, or sticky. Products that absorb quickly with hydration that lasts all day.\n\n    Cur\u00e9l Skincare is on a mission to End Dry Skin, and we won\u2019t stop until our mission is completed. We can\u2019t wait to see what incredible things people can accomplish with their dry skin worries behind them.\n\n                            Cur\u00e9l, the end of dry skin, the beginning of so much more.", "190": "Title: DAILY HEALING\nORIGINAL LOTION FOR DRY SKIN; Description: \u2022 Provides instant relief and protects the skin from dryness for over 24 hours\n\u2022 Great for all over body use, even providing relief to over-washed dry hands\n\u2022 Non-greasy, quick absorbing lotion features time-released moisturizers to hydrate and relieve dry skin\n\u2022 Dermatologist Recommended\n\u2022 Made with our Advanced Ceramide Complex, the lotion restores skin's ceramide levels to help retain moisture and prevent symptoms of dry, damaged skin from returning\n\u2022 Skin is left smooth, comforted, and intensely satisfied\n\u2022 Can safely be used on face without clogging pores\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nCur\u00e9l\u00ae Daily Healing Lotion, with Advanced Ceramide Complex, restores skin's ceramide levels to help retain moisture and prevent symptoms of dry skin from returning.

Klarna provides smooth payments to more than 200,000 online stores. Over 90 million consumers worldwide trust Klarna to securely handle their payments.\n\n\nHow does Pay later in 30 days work?\n\nPay later in 30 days is a form of credit which allows you to delay payment of your purchase by 30 days without interest or fees. Once your order is confirmed, you'll receive an email with payment instructions from Klarna. You'll then have 30 days until your payment is due. You can pay via credit or debit card in the Klarna app or by logging into www.klarna.com/uk.\n\n\nAm I eligible for Pay later in 30 days?\n\nTo use Pay later in 30 days you must be at least 18 years old and a UK resident. Your application approval is subject to Klarna's review of the details you provide and your financial circumstances.\n\n\nCan I have multiple Pay later in 30 days orders at the same time?\n\nYes, you can. As long as you see the option for Klarna Pay later in 30 at checkout, you can choose to make a new Pay later in 30 order . Each individual application is subject to an independent approval which may take outstanding orders into consideration.\n\n\nHow can I increase my chances of being accepted for Pay later in 30 days?\n\nKlarna offers Pay later in 30 days based on a number of factors such as the order value, previous order history and item availability. If you are 18 or over, you can improve your chances of being offered Pay later in 30 days by ensuring you provide your full name, accurate address details and arrange shipping to your registered billing address. All orders are assessed individually. Just because you have been accepted for Pay later in 30 days before does not mean it will be offered for every order. In turn, if your application for Pay later in 30 days is denied, it does not mean it will be denied for future orders.\n\n\nWill a credit search take place?\n\nIn order to assess your application to use Pay later in 30 days, Klarna may carry out a soft credit search with the credit reference agencies who supply Klarna with credit information. These do not affect your credit score and are only visible to you and Klarna, but are not visible to other lenders. Neither Klarna nor Molton Brown run credit searches against you for Pay later in 30 days that impact your credit rating.\n\n\nWhat are my payment options with Klarna?\n\nYou can pay with debit or credit card immediately in the checkout or you can take advantage of the Pay later in 30 days payment option, where you can pay for the goods once you have received them via credit card or debit card. You can look out for your outstanding payments in the Klarna app.\n\n\nWhat happens if I cancel or return my order?\n\nAs soon as Molton Brown has accepted your cancellation/return, then Klarna will cancel the statement or refund your payment. The return will be reflected in the Klarna app immediately.\n\n\nWhen do I need to pay for my order?\n\nPayment is due 30 days after your goods have been shipped. To help you pay on time, Klarna will send you friendly reminders in advance of your due date. You will receive a push notification from the Klarna app and email reminders to pay.\n\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t pay for my order on time?\n\nIf you fail to pay on time, you will be in default, and may be unable to use Klarna credit products in the future. You will not be charged fees or interest for late or missed repayments. Your credit score will not be impacted by using Klarna\u2019s Pay later in 30 days product even if you have failed to pay on time.\n\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t pay for my order?\n\nIf you do not pay for your purchase, Klarna may engage with an external debt collection agency to collect the debt on behalf of Klarna.\n\n\nI have been asked to go to the Klarna site. Is this correct?\n\nIf you have chosen to Pay later in 30 days, Klarna will send you an email with further details on how to pay. Your email will contain a link to Klarna where you can settle your payment with your credit or debit card.\n\n\nWhat do I need to provide when I make a purchase?\n\nIf you want to make a purchase with Klarna you need to provide your name, address, date of birth, telephone number and email address.

With a full return, your statement will be closed. You are always able to monitor the status of your order in the Klarna app.\n\n\nI've received a statement, but I've not yet received my goods.\n\nYou have 30 days to pay, so you don\u2019t need to pay right away.

They have a natural mindset that focuses on the individual \u2013 a trendsetting notion for the time. Hand-mixing botanical hair care products in the basement of their salon, they attract an exclusive celebrity clientele, tended by the best stylists in the country whose work graces countless Vogue covers. The duo\u2019s care for the planet really leads the way; they refuse to test on animals and they create an in-house vegetarian restaurant \u2013 today, all of our formulas are 100% vegetarian. And taking inspiration from our original natural hair care products, we\u2019ve created a contemporary Botanical Hair Care collection using sustainably sourced herbs.\n\nAn image of Molton Brown packaging for the 1980's\nThe \u201980s:\nBranching Out To Pastures New\nWe introduce our first signature scent in 1984 \u2013 Orange Grove Bath & Body collection, currently known as Orange & Bergamot. As well as featuring one of the country\u2019s first upscale hand washes, the collection is provided to a London five-star hotel partner, making us one of the first luxury British amenity houses to supply hotels. The same year as this launch, our founders move production to their country home at Mott\u2019s Hall, Elsenham, growing herbs in their garden for their collections, and drying them in the barn. We\u2019ve stayed in England ever since; now, the majority of our products are manufactured in our Elsenham facility, just a couple of miles away from Motts Hall. To round off this exciting era, we release a book called \u2018A Way of Looking\u2019 which puts into words Molton Brown\u2019s ethos on unique, holistic beauty.\n\nAn image of Jacques Chabert the founder of Molton Brown\nThe \u201990s & \u201900s:\nIcons In The Making\nIn 1990, we formalise our planet-friendly promise by sharing our Environmental Statement, which defines our commitment from day one: \u2018we never test on animals and never will\u2019. Skip along a decade or so to when our iconic Re-charge Black Pepper fragrance is created by Master Perfumer Jacques Chabert, who we still have a close friendship with today \u2013 he also makes another Molton Brown favourite, Heavenly Gingerlily. Since its arrival, Re-charge Black Pepper becomes a winning scent, collecting countless awards. Its status sees Jacques' daughter Carla, who follows in her father\u2019s perfumery footsteps, create its popular partner Fiery Pink Pepper ten years later, as well as the much-loved Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel.\n\n\"When you look at any brand that has sustained 50 years, they have always stayed true to themselves, true to their core values\"\nCaroline Burstein, Co-founder and a friend of Molton Brown today\n\n\n\nThe \u201910s:\nResponsibly Building Our British Roots\nThis decade sees us build both our proud British legacy and our sustainability journey.

It's a way for you to express yourself and shouldn't be limited by trends. Either you like a more natural look or heavier on the makeup, it's up to you, your choice and just have fun with it. A great exercise for me is observing people in the streets and see what kind of makeup they're wearing and the looks they achieve without being a professional makeup artist. Most of the times I see perfection in their imperfections.

Nagase was on a mission to do things differently \u2014 to make high-quality facial soap that was also affordable. He called it \u201cKao,\u201d pronounced the same way as the Japanese word for \u201cface\u201d (makes sense, right?).\n \nAs the first skincare brand to focus on the root of problem skin \u2014 THE PORE \u2014 Bior\u00e9 Skincare has taken a \u201cDo Different\u201d approach since the very beginning. Even though we create our own line of high quality, affordable skincare products in Europe and in the U.S., we develop formulas according to the Japanese beauty philosophy of functionality and simplicity with long-term results. If you have been to Japan, you may have noticed a similar line of Bior\u00e9 products. While the formulas and development are separate from those in Europe or the U.S. , we\u2019re able to leverage our parent company\u2019s innovative Japanese technology, backed by years of scientific research and development \u2014 hello, skincare jackpot!\n \nOur Japanese beauty roots inspire us to advance and enhance everything we do \u2014 innovation is in our DNA. When it comes to cleaning and caring for those 20,000 pesky pores, we\u2019re all about working smarter, not harder. We\u2019re serious about helping you get the skin of your dreams, but we\u2019re also serious about making it fun, affordable and truly achievable.", "350": "Title: Our Commitment; Description: ECO- FRIENDLY\n\nDoing different starts with our ingredients, but doesn\u2019t end there.

That\u2019s why all the Bior\u00e9 products in the UK and our western markets are vegan friendly. We do not test our products or the materials within them on animals and we do not use any animal-derived ingredients.\n \nWe follow the conventions of the EU and other governmental bans on animal testing for cosmetics. Occasionally, laws and regulations require testing of materials outside of the cosmetics category. Kao\u2019s efforts to find alternatives to animal testing for cosmetics started more than thirty years ago, well before the official EU legislation in 2004.\n\nINGREDIENT SAFETY\n\nOur goal is to bring you the best products with superior technology and that starts with safety.

After all, without them we\u2019d have nowhere for hair to grow out of, no method for skin oils to reach the surface, protecting skin from environmental dehydration.\n\nTechnically speaking, the pore is little more than the opening of the hair follicle onto the surface of the skin. The source of the hair follicle lies deep within the dermis. Midway up the dermal layer, the sebaceous oil gland empties into the hair follicle. Both skin oil (sebum) and the hair breach the surface through this tiny aperture. Wherever there is a hair, there will be a pore.", "353": "Title: Can clogged pores cause breakouts?; Description: Yes. Dirt and oil collect around your pores, creating build-up that can clog the skin follicle. If bacteria make its way to the blockage and grow, this can cause inflammation and may progress into breakouts. Swelling and redness may linger in the form of whiteheads and red inflamed patches of skin. Other clogged pores like blackheads may not have the same markers of swelling, redness and inflammation but still contribute to zapping skin\u2019s beauty potential.", "354": "Title: Why do I need to use pore strips if I\u2019m already using cleanser and scrub?; Description: Our Bior\u00e9 Pore Strips are for instantly removing the plugs that have already formed in the pores, which liquid cleansers can\u2019t completely remove by themselves. While cleansers are excellent at cleaning deep inside pores that have not yet become plugged or impacted and may help prevent some plugs from occurring, they may not prevent plugs completely. You will still need the pore strips to remove the plugs that do occur.", "355": "Title: How do Bior\u00e9 Pore Strips work?; Description: Bior\u00e9 Pore Strips feature proprietary Cationic Bond Technology that has a positive charge while the blackheads are negatively charged. The two bind tightly and the plug can then be pulled out effectively when the strip is pulled gently off and away from the skin.", "356": "Title: What are the benefits of using Bior\u00e9 Pore Strips?; Description: When used once a week, Bior\u00e9 Pore Strips are proven to minimise the appearance of pores and minimise the re-occurrence of blackheads.", "357": "Title: What makes Bior\u00e9 cleansers, washes and scrubs different from competitors?; Description: Traditional cleansers trap and wash dirt away, while also leaving behind individual molecules, which can penetrate skin and disrupt your skin\u2019s natural moisture barrier, leading to: dry patches, oilier skin and clogged pores.\n\n\n\nBior\u00e9 Cleansers feature Skin Purifying Technology that allows for selective cleansing \u2013 cleansing molecules target dirt, not your skin\u2019s natural moisture. Like a magnet it locks onto problem-causing dirt, oil, and impurities. When the job is done, individual molecules are attracted to each other and are swept away, leaving fewer molecules behind. This leads to: high cleansibility, low potential for damage and irritation with skin\u2019s natural moisture remaining intact, which means it lessens the chance of vulnerability to more issues.", "358": "Title: Which Bior\u00e9 range is suited to my skin type?; Description: Bior\u00e9 Charcoal Range is ideal for normal to oily skin. You have this skin type if your skin on the entire face gets shiny / greasy two hours after your wash your face. Bior\u00e9 Blue Agave + Baking Soda Range is ideal for combination skin. You have this skin type if your T-zone (your forehead and nose) is oily and your cheeks are dry.\n", "359": "Title: What do Charcoal and Blue Agave + Baking Soda do?\n; Description: Charcoal is a powerful natural ingredient known for its ability to absorb oil and impurities. Bior\u00e9 charcoal products, with charcoal and Skin Purifying Technology, work like a magnet to draw out pore-clogging dirt and give oily skin a deep clean.\n\nBlue Agave is a plant found in Mexico. Back in the days, its nectar was used by the Aztecs for hundreds of years as a folk remedy for many types of skin conditions. It's known for its properties to condition and soothe dry skin. Baking Soda is a powerful exfoliant found in nature. On its own, natural baking soda is an alkaline that can dry the skin. Bior\u00e9 Blue Agave + Baking Soda products take all the natural powerful soothing properties of Blue Agave and cleansing and exfoliating properties of Baking Soda but they have been formulated precisely for use on your skin, so you get all the same benefits without damaging your skin.

For sales-orientated tasks, employees need the corresponding additional qualifications.\n\nService staff should also have the ability to organise themselves and their work and must, of course, be familiar with and understand the processes and relationships of the service sector.

We would like to introduce you to some of these interesting ways below, because all companies today should aim to cut CO2 and create renewable energies!\n\n\nOur newly developed software \u2013 less paper consumption, more efficiency!\nIn logistics, it is customary for orders to be shipped with a printed-out packing slip. This results in mountains of paper that have to be destroyed at a great cost following completion of the order, because printed paper cannot be 100% recycled. In our opinion, this method is neither environmentally friendly nor modern. Therefore, we have developed a highly complex program that functions completely without paper. Our employees are now equipped with a small energy-saving device, on which the new software is installed. It uses less energy than a conventional smartphone and is charged with electricity from the solar electricity we have produced ourselves. Here\u2019s the best part: Paper is saved, the forests are preserved, and the flexibility of this new program also enables ordered goods to be dispatched even more quickly and efficiently.\n\n\nWe produce more energy than we use!\nBy investing in an approx. 600 m2 photovoltaic system, we produce up to 8 megawatt hours per month at our logistics centre. (By way of comparison, a four-person household needs approx. 4.4 megawatt hours per year) Our electricity generation is thus higher than our consumption. We use the electricity directly, and when \u201ctoo much\u201d electricity is produced, it is fed into the ENBW network.\n\n\nMore light, less energy, greater welfare!\nLighting is a big issue for all companies that have to light large office spaces or halls. Lighting alone is estimated to consume approx. 25% of all energy. With the help of experts from LTG-Germany, we have reduced the energy consumption of conventional lighting by approx. 60% by using the latest LED technology, while significantly improving the lighting of our offices and storage facilities at the same. This means: a saving of approx. 60%! previously, approx. 40% of conventional lighting had to be replaced at a great expense every year due to the long lifespan.\nAnother significant factor is the influence of lighting on the work environment and well-being of our employees, which we were also able to improve by making this modification.\n\nOur ambition\nWe make all of these investments sustainably and with conviction. Therefore, you can be certain that we will also continue to strive to find ways of protecting our environment.\n\n", "427": "Title: Partner programm; Description: Earn money with the parfumdreams partner programme!\n\n1\nIntegrate parfumdreams advertising material in your website\n2\nYour visitors click on the banner and are taken directly to parfumdreams.de\n3\nEarn attractive commissions with parfumdreams\n\nIt\u2019s as easy as one, two, three:\nSelect a network\nIt costs you nothing to participate in the parfumdreams partner programme.

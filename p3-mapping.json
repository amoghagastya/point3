The result of one of our early and most iconic partnerships with the master perfumer Jacques Chabert, our Re-charge Black Pepper collection is adventurous, energising and confident. Grown in Madagascar, black peppercorns unveil powerful, spicy and fruity flavours. It is a pepper that provides an outstanding finish, both sharp and refined. The pepper plant is a vigorous vine with small green flowers grouped in long clusters, which give way to fleshy fruits of varying colours depending on maturity. Black pepper, as we recognise it, is the full mature peppercorn, picked when tinged with red. Several days of sun drying transforms these fleshy berries into shrivelled black kernels with a strong, spicy aroma. Re-charge black pepper has come to achieve iconic status because of its distinctive clash between bright citrus and deep woody notes. When Jacques revisited our original re-charge black pepper collection in 2019 to begin the creation of our Eau de Parfum, it was the characteristic spiciness of the black peppercorns that really drew him to an ingredient that would amplify and enhance this bold warmth. The ingredient Jacques selected was myrtle pepper. Myrtle pepper, otherwise known as all spice or pimento, comes from the unripened berries of the evergreen pimento tree. Robust and complex with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, it\u2019s a spicy accent that adds a rich dimension to the overall fragrance.", "56": "Title: Orange & Bergamot; Description: A Sevillian courtyard of sun-dappled citrus trees.

The launch of our unforgettable citrus fragrance was the true beginning of our hotel partnerships which, until this day, sees our products in five-star hotels across the globe. In 2018, we partnered with master perfumer Beverley Bayne, a close friend of Michael Pickthall, to reinvent our Orange and Bergamot Collection. Our aim was to modernise this fragrance with contemporary ingredients whilst remaining true to Michaels original vision. In 2019 we once again sought Beverley\u2019s creative expertise as we launched our very first collection of Eau de Parfum. Beverley revisited the original inspiration for our iconic collection and staying true to the very heart of the fragrance, she selected a signature note of petitgrain. Petitgrain is steam distilled and extracted from the leaves and bark of the bitter orange tree. It takes around five hundred to six hundred kilograms of leaves to yield just one kilogram of petitgrain. It adds a fresh, green woodiness and entwines beautifully with the other orange tree elements, bringing depth and radiance to a classic collection.

Through experimentation and vibrant pink inspiration, Carla sought an ingredient that was as bold and striking, in its natural form, as pink pepper. Osmanthus\u2026 this was the perfect addition. Bright, dramatic, and eccentric, osmanthus shares a rich, natural synergy and gives an apricot sweetness to pink pepper. Carla shares her thoughts on how osmanthus and pink pepper interact as she says, \u201cOsmanthus is a sweet floral with a leathery kick that echoes the spiciness of the pink pepper\u201d.", "59": "Title: Delicious Rhubarb & Rose; Description: Delicious Rhubarb & Rose A Molton Brown Icon A just-baked slice of crimson spring tart. Mouth-watering, bright grapefruit trickled over scattered petals of freshly picked, soft rose. The tang of tart rhubarb leaf folded into a swirl of creamy vanilla for an utterly moreish touch. Be irresistibly indulged; treat your senses to a delectably sweet recipe with a citrus twist. Vivacious. Fizzy. Tempting VIDEO TRANSCRIPT Inspired by the sweetness of a crisp summer tart, our Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is a fizzy, tempting fragrance which symbolises the very essence of sharp Yorkshire rhubarb. Procured from January to late March, forced rhubarb is grown in the dark in the wonderfully named Rhubarb Triangle in Yorkshire. Rhubarb is so beloved of northern gardens because the cool damp conditions produce the sweetest, most succulent storks. Whether baked into a mouth-watering dessert or simply dipped in sugar, rhubarb has a distinctively cheerful appearance and taste. Our Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is the creation of senior perfumer Vanessa Prudent. Born in Normandy, Vanessa discovered an early passion for fragrance through nature. She has had the pleasure of travelling across the world and this is where she has found her biggest inspiration. Discovering new places evokes a curiosity, an emotion she uses in her perfumery. Using rhubarb sourced from the luscious gardens of the Yorkshire Triangle, Vanessa began crafting an irresistible, floral fruity fragrance which would soon become a favourite of all who experienced it. Our Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is a true floral fruity. Rhubarb spikes a bitter top note as zesty fruits fizz with a citrus twist. These contrast with the sweetness of spun sugar in the base. Our gentle rose extract and vanilla bring to life the buttery pastry of a dessert.", "60": "Title: Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel; Description: Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel is a true Molton Brown Icon.

Explore on the edge; awash your senses with a sea-soaked quest. Get inspired and discover more about this iconic collection by watching the video below: VIDEO TRANSCRPT A rich interpretation of azure blue, our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Collection is a bracing, marine inspired fragrance which expresses the very essence of the rugged, ever-changing coastline. Marine notes are accompanied by striking, naturally blue cypress oil. Blue cypress oil, sometimes referred to as blue gold, is similar to sandalwood oil and vetiver oil with long lasting, warm, woody base notes, and earthy tones. It combines well with lavender, lemon mrytle, citrus, and floral oils. Our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Collection is the creation of senior perfumer Carla Chabert, the daughter of world-renowned master perfumer, Jacques Chabert. Her personal love affair with fragrance began as a child after she attended a client\u2019s house with her mother. This hugely resonated with her, remembering the scents, textures, and perfume bottles of that particular meeting with deep affection. Using a combination of blue cypress oil, marine notes, and cardamom, to name a few, Carla began crafting an uplifting, compelling fragrance which would soon gain iconic status. Just two years on from the launch of our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Collection, we once again requested Carla\u2019s expert nose as we began the journey to creating our very first Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Eau de Parfum. For Carla, the ingredient that was going to truly elevate our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Eau de Parfum was the noble cardamom. Whilst cardamom is not a new addition to this collection, a heavy dose enhances the depth of the fragrance, highlighting the freshness on the top to add strength and vibrancy. For Carla, this overdose of cardamom was an instinctive choice and one which truly elevates our Eau de Parfum to a salt sprayed collision of ingredients.", "61": "Title: Icons Quiz; Description: The Discovery Guide Icons Quiz Congratulations on completing the Icon section of this training module.

However, we want to assure you that there are plenty of ways to \"Eliminate those Ouches!\" Click on each image below for more detailed information: The Pandemic Some customers may not feel ready to experience a Hand & Arm Massage. That's fine - reassure them that they can book the service in the future once they are feeling more relaxed and comfortable with the idea. You can also discuss the Me Time Hand & Arm Massage where you can match and mirror your customer by conducting a Hand & Arm Massage with them at the hub. We will go over how you can offer this service to your customers later in this module. No Time One of the Ouches we hear often is that it is too busy in store or there isn't enough time to conduct a Hand & Arm Massage. This tends to be the case for Outlets and Wholesale stores. However, we have come up an express, 'no water, no problem' Hand & Arm Massage. This can be conducted in any location to surprise and delight your customers. Similarly, the Hand & Arm Massage is broken down into steps and techniques so you can adapt it to the amount of time you and your customer has. Technique One common Ouch is that we may be reluctant to carry out a Hand & Arm Massage as we are unsure of the correct techniques to use to effectively conduct the massage. This can be unsettling for you and for your customer. You will get a full breakdown of the Hand & Arm Massage techniques with videos and additional tools to support you when offering and carrying out these service signatures. Gender We understand that at times some customers may feel uncomfortable receiving a Hand & Arm massage from a member of the perceived opposite sex, but there are ways around this. Do not feel offended - it could be because of somebodies religious beliefs or personal experiences. Ask the customer if they feel comfortable to proceed with you, and if they don\u2019t... You can see if another member of the team is available to conduct the service.

Personal Ouches The Pandemic You may feel that you are not ready to complete a hand & arm massage. That may be the case but we still need to make our customers aware that we have now introduced this service experience and it is available when they feel ready to do so. There are currently no regulations preventing cosmetic or beauty treatments from taking place. Please discuss with your line manager if you need additional support.\t Gender We understand that at times some customers may feel uncomfortable receiving a Hand & Arm massage from a member of the opposite sex and similarly there may be members of the team who feel uncomfortable too. There are ways around this. If you feel uncomfortable to proceed with a service - then speak to your manager discreetly and maybe partner up with someone to share the role of conducting a Hand & Arm Massage. Confidence \t Ouches Eliminated One of the most common ouches is that individuals within a team are reluctant to carry out a hand & arm massage as they are unsure if they are doing the service correctly and using the right technique. By completing this learning and practicing the techniques regularly in your store with colleagues will ensure that you build your confidence. There might be other ouches that you can identify. Discuss these with your line manager so that they can provide you with the tools you need to eliminate them.

Once you have watched the video, practice with a fellow team member to develop your skills. A Walk-In Hand & Arm Massage should last 5-10 minutes. During a Walk-In experience, you will massage and demonstrate our products on only one of the customers arms. This enables the customer to see and smell the benefits of layering products. If your customer has loved their experience, they will most likely ask you to do their other arm too! This is a good thing - it means they are happy and are likely to purchase. If both you and they have time, conduct the Hand & Arm Massage on their other arm too. Video Player As you would have seen in the video, the 'Up and Over Technique' in the Nourish step can look a little simple unless done correctly. Below shows you how to apply pressure with your fingers and thumb when completing this technique to ensure an effective massage is given to the customer. When you are working your way up the arm, apply pressure to the outside of the arm with your four fingers. Imagine your hand is like a claw. Your entire palm and fingers should be in contact with the customers arm at all times. When you are working your way down the arm, apply pressure with your thumb down the other side of the arm. This will ensure all aspects of the muscle are massaged. The video below helps demonstrate this...

Delivering a great lasting impression can be a deciding factor as to whether the customer will shop with you again or not, and isn't necessarily carried out in the final moments spent with your customer. Always be aware of what you say and do throughout the customers journey. Below we outline a few examples of how to deliver a positive lasting impression during a Hand & Arm Massage: Passion Being knowledgeable about or products is one thing, but being passionate about them and your role at Molton Brown is what customers will really connect with and remember! Always find the positive in a fragrance collection or product, even if it isn't your personal favourite. Our role as fragrance experts is to encourage customers to express themselves.

This is the difference between a scripted service and a personal service - share your top tips with your customers during a Hand & Arm massage using the edutainment tools as your reference. Now that you have seen some examples of things to consider to deliver a fantastic lasting impression with your customers... What other ways can you create a fantastic Lasting Impression? Think about other ways you believe you can create a great lasting impression with your customers: ", "81": "Title: Hand & Arm Massages First Impressions; Description: First Impressions Menu Hand & Arm Massage - First Impressions Whether your customer is a new or regular Molton Brown shopper, offering them a Hand & Arm Massage is an excellent way to establish rapport and a fantastic first impression. Did you know? Touch creates symbolic connections between people and products, and between buyers and sellers. Physically holding products can create a sense of psychological ownership, driving must-have purchase decisions! There are various customer types that you will encounter on any given day. We have identified four common customer types and how you can offer both a walk in and bookable/elevated Hand & Arm massage to them. Click on each image below to learn more: \"I know what I want\" Just because this customer says they know what they want - doesn't mean they wouldn't be interested in trying a product on their skin, or experiencing other collections they might enjoy. This customer type can sometimes come across quite dismissive - Perhaps it could be because of time constraints or because they have been sent in to purchase a product for someone else. A good way to get around this is to start the conversation with some of the words below: \"I can see...\" \"Did you know...\" For example: \"I can see you are stocking up on our Re-charge Black Pepper B&SG. Did you know, this collection now includes an Eau de Parfum and Eau de Toilette, do you have 5 minutes to try it for yourself?\" (If your customer is male, keep it simple and introduce the fragrance as an aftershave) Simply asking your customer if they have a few minutes to try a product on their skin could result in them actually spending more time with you and increases the chances of them making a purchase! If they don't have the time, this is when you can use one of your Bounce Back Invitations to invite them in again when they have more time to indulge. \"I need some help\" These are fantastic customers! As they have expressed that they need some help or advice from you, they are generally more willing to spend time experiencing the products and listening to what you have to tell them. This is the perfect time to utilise the Universal Profiling Questions! Once you have established their needs using our UPQ's, ask the customer, \"Why not take the opportunity to indulge in a decadent Hand & Arm Massage? It is the perfect way to experience our products\" Listen closely to any exciting event opportunities a customer might drop into conversation such as upcoming birthday's, weddings etc. as you could potentially host a bespoke VIP event for this customer and boost your KPI's! \"I'm just browsing\" Browsing customers can generally come across as quite abrupt and dismissive towards you. Sometimes a customer is browsing just to pass time whilst they are waiting for somebody or something. Other times they might be browsing to get gift ideas for themselves or others, but one fact remains, they have walked into your store for a reason. Don't miss a potential sales opportunity! This is another opportunity to engage with a Universal Profiler Question such as \"What do you know about Molton Brown?\" This opens up the doors of possibility to find out if they have used and experienced our products before. Why not say: \"Just to let you know I am available to deliver a Hand & Arm Massage today and introduce you to our Molton Brown fragrance collections and their benefits\" \"I'd like a fully immersive experience\" Fantastic! These customers are fanatics about Molton Brown and would probably be part of your team if they could! They have a wealth of knowledge of past and current collections and love nothing more than getting to be amongst the first to experience and buy new collections. Fully immersive customers make themselves known by taking products to the basins to try, using the fragrance testers and usually ask about our services. Invite these customers to enjoy an elevated Hand & Arm Massage if they have the time - highlighting that they have been significantly elevated. As these customers love to feel extra-special, why not handwrite them an invitation to an upcoming store event or an elevated Fragrance Consultation? Setting the scene means to create the conditions in which something can happen. It is crucial to creating a great First Impression for your customers, whether it is a quick 5-10 minute Hand & Arm Massage or a bookable/elevated fully immersive experience. Ensuring we are fully prepared for the day will ensure smooth service for the customer and yourself! Follow the steps below to setting the scene: Testers Are your product testers suitably full for use? There is nothing worse than trying to showcase a product that is nearly empty! Make sure all testers are ready to be used by your team and customers at the start of each day. If another tester needs to be created, speak to a member of management.  Water & Basins At the start of each day, ensure that there is hot water running to the basin sinks*. If not, raise this with a manager to ensure it is fixed. If your basins do not have hot water, not to worry - half fill them with cold water and mix with warm water from the taps back of house. Remember to run taps for 5 minutes each day to eliminate the potential of legionella. *Only applicable to stores with basins. Towels Whether you are using paper napkin towels or premium cotton towels, ensure that you have enough in stock and laundered ready for use each day. Towels should look and feel luxurious - even paper napkins. If you need more paper napkins, please speak to your manager who will be able to order more. Refreshments If you are offering your customers a refreshment, ensure that you have the drink available to serve them and that it is chilled - there is nothing worse than warm bubbly! Remember to ask your customer if they have any dietary requirements so that you can check for them on the ingredients on the side of the bottle. Usually, most customers are quite content with a glass of still or sparkling water, or even a cup of coffee. Consider your staff in store - can you leave the shop floor for several minutes to fetch a cup of coffee? Only offer what is feasible for a seamless customer experience. Techniques Finally, you need to ensure that you have practiced and are confident in the techniques used to differentiate between a walk-in Hand & Arm Massage to those used in a bookable/elevated experience. We want you to feel positive about carrying out every Molton Brown Service Signature with your customers. If after this module you still feel you require additional support, speak to your manager who will guide you through the techniques. Before you begin your Hand & Arm Massage, walk your customer through the collections asking them a series of Universal Profiler Questions to identify their needs. Through this you can determine which collections to introduce and use whilst carrying out the Hand & Arm Massage. Click each button below to learn about other ways to help set the scene: Prepare the Hub Once you have selected the products with your customer, ensure that they are open and ready to be used throughout the service. Top tip: Position the products in a line in the order you are going to apply them to your customers skin. Ensure you have a full supply of paper towels to use. Be prepared and unfold two paper towels before you start the service Fragrance Arc Before you begin delivering the Hand & Arm Massage with your customer, Let them know you are going to place a towel over their lap for protection. Spray an arc of the chosen Eau de Parfum or Eau de Toilette in a halo above the hub. This will gently scent the space and fully immerse yourself and the customer in olfactive bliss. Jewellery If you or your customer are wearing jewellery such as rings or bracelets, we do advise that you politely ask them to be removed. Product such as the body polisher can get caught in any grooves and you could catch the palm of your hands on any sharp edges. Suggest to your customer that they place their items on a napkin in front of them to keep a close eye on, or of course, they can put their belongings in their bag for safe-keeping. If you are wearing rings, store them safely until after the service is complete.

At Molton Brown we want to elevate and enhance our current service signatures to further establish our credentials as a truly experiential and luxury brand. An overview of the elevated Service Signatures The world of retail has changed rapidly in the past couple of years, with customers drawn to a more experiential retail environment.

For those of you who have been with Molton Brown for a while, you will undoubtedly notice some of the different ways in which we have elevated these experiences. Fragrance Consultations As part of our mission to be recognised as a fragrance first retailer, we have reviewed our current fragrance consultation proposition and re-worked it to include a blend of education and entertainment to enhance the customers experience. We have also provided YOU with some exciting tools to achieve this.  Edutainment What is Edutainment? Edutainment is a method to entertain whilst educating our customers on our products, our brand and provides them with a fully immersive experience that showcases your skills and your knowledge of Molton Brown. We have created a set of tools covering everything from our heritage, sustainability credentials, iconic products and even how the sense of smell works. Each tool is broken down into small points to enable bite size learning. We know that our customers love to experience our products but also learn about them too - remember, it is the benefits of a product that helps to sell it! Events In-store events and activities are incredibly important to encourage customer interaction, sales growth and customer life time value. We have in the past focused on hosting events only when new products are released. To relinquish our dependence on new collections, we have reviewed our eventing proposition so that you are empowered to host an event with any iconic collection, whenever you choose. Why do I need to know about the elevated Service Signatures? As an employee of Molton Brown, it is an essential part of your job to deliver the FLOW philosophy with every customer that walks into your store.

Consistent Service We want to ensure that whether a customer walks into one of our stand alone stores, an outlet or even a wholesale door, the experiences delivered are as consistent in technique as possible. This will also help you build your confidence in delivering the various techniques required for each of the services. KPIs Of course, whilst offering luxurious services to our customers to enjoy, our products help to set us apart from some of our competitors - they are also a sales technique to help boost our KPIs. Once a customer gets to feel and experience the product on their skin, they have made a physical connection to the product and begin to desire them once they understand the benefits and value of each product used.

This will help you to understand its olfactive profile and also give you ideas as to what other fragrances to suggest to your customer. Click on each cross below to learn more. Primary - Ambery Defined as warm, opulent and mysterious, ambery fragrances are originally built around raw materials such as ambergris and musk, combined with woody, tobacco, spicy and marine facets. With access to synthetic ingredients, contemporary ambery perfumes are softer, usually featuring vanilla, labdanum, cinnamon, pepper or oudh accord. Secondary - Floral/Rose One of the most popular and ancient families in perfume history. As its name implies, flowers take centre stage to create a fragrant bouquet with blossoms such as rose, jasmine, violet, iris, lily, lily of the valley, narcissus or tuberose. Rose Dunes is classed as more of a Rose fragrance due to the prominence of both romantic rose and rose-like geranium. Using your knowledge of our fragrances and the families, what other fragrance could you suggest to your customer if they like Rose Dunes? Please select one fragrance below: Mesmerising Oudh Accord & Gold Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel The Eau de Toilette is a celebration of rose with rich cassis that glistens at the top, softened by intimate saffron and velvety rose. The earthy-mossy base is deepened by patchouli and pulses of resinous amber. The Eau de Parfum is an addictive fragrance that is hypnotic. Fresh Madagascan pepper and ginger is wrapped by a dark bloom of rose. An addictive oudh accord awaits in the lingering base of sandalwood, musk and vetiver. Fragrance Facts Concentrations Flip The Eau de Parfum contains 20% fragrance oil meaning that it will last on a persons skin for up to 8 hours. For added longevity, explain the benefits of layering with the matching body lotion. The Eau de Toilette is much lighter by design and is meant to be applied liberally for an instant ambery top-up! Notes There are two notes that are important for different reasons in the fragrance collection. Signature note - Patchouli Sulawesi Perfumer Philippe has overdosed the Patchouli note for added depth, sensuality and earthiness in the Eau de Parfum. Overarching note - Rose The rose note used throughout the entire collection is rich, velvety and romantic. Resin Cap he unique resin cap design is inspired by the rich colours found in a sunset over the sand dunes of the Arabian desert.

Our Scented Candles and Aroma Reeds have been carefully reformulated with higher fragrance concentrations for an exceptional experience. These come in a selection of our best-loved, award-winning Fragrances to set an uplifting, refreshing or relaxing ambience. Let's discover why scenting our homes has become more important than ever... The Home Sanctuary In 2020, due to the pandemic, much of the world suddenly had to adapt to a new way of working - with many people working from their homes instead of office environments. Because of this, an increasing number of people wanted to make their home a comfortable sanctuary to live and work in. In August 2020, The Times newspaper reported that candle sales at Selfridges increased by 54% since March 2020, while candle sales at Diptyque increased by 100% year on year. With a new way of working here to stay, we anticipate the demand for beautifully scented spaces to continue to grow... Below are some interesting statistics on fragrance and home scenting that were a direct result of the impact of COVID-19 restrictions. 56% of consumers took comfort in scents more than they did before Covid-19 lockdowns! The pandemic resulted in fewer occasions for personal fragrances to be worn, but increased the demand for home fragrances. The demand for home scenting increased drastically, with consumers happy to spend considerable sums on candles & aroma reeds to scent their homes with.  With the increasing popularity to showcase objects of desire on social media, combined with spending more time at home, consumers are drawn to items that are aesthetically pleasing as well as practical for their purpose. The need for packaging goes beyond its initial purpose, with customers wanting to repurpose the vessels and display them on shelves or coffee tables. Read the three key pillars below that helped guide us with the design of our Home Collection restage. More Than A Candle Luxury home fragrances are required to go beyond their first function with elevated packaging and reinvented formats to keep customers engaged. With this in mind, we decided to revamp our Home Collection with a timeless, sleek and minimal design that anyone would be proud to showcase in their home. Repurpose As more of us stayed at home due to lockdown demands, we were suddenly faced with the reality of how much waste we generate. Our new home collection's outer packaging has been massively reduced and the new design encourages customers to repurpose their vessels and do their part in reducing their environmental impact! From Office to Bedroom For the majority, switching off from working at home can be difficult. Finding ways to create a separation between work and home are limited. It is incredibly important to create a feeling of sanctuary and relaxation - and home scenting plays a huge part in being able to do this and transport us to other places and times! Our 3 key objectives Strengthen our Home Category through a new elevated design and home accessories with improved product & fragrance performance. Increase our category productivity by focusing our offer on best selling fragrances and covering key olfactive families for the Home Fragrance Category. Continue building our ESG (Environmental Social Governance) credentials through sustainable packaging and refillable solutions.

OUR OFFICES AND MANUFATURING FACILITY SAVING ENERGY SAVING ENERGY We use light motion detection sensors in all of our office spaces and meeting rooms, which automatically switch off lights after 15 minutes of non-activity. The majority of our lightbulbs are now energy saving LED, although there are some areas within our manufacturing plant which we are in the process of converting. \u2022 We optimise our manufacturing schedules to provide greater continuity in the production runs; to reduce the need to start/ stop the manufacturing or filling lines. This helps to save energy and water used in the sanitisation process required between each new run. PRINTING \u2022 We have designated printers on each of our office floors that centralises all printing needs. Employees are reminded only to print documents that are absolutely essential to have in a hard copy. All printers have a default setting of printing on both sides to reduce paper waste. OFFICES & STORES OFFICES & STORES PRINTING \u2022 We purchase electricity for our Manufacturing Facility, Green Street offices and our Stores from renewable sources only (wind, solar and tidal). This means that with the exception of our heating (currently diesel and gasoline) all our energy is green. At this time the electricity supplied to our Shaftesbury Avenue office is sourced via the Service Charge for the building. Therefore we cannot confirm if this is from a Green Energy source at this time. \u2022 We have Zip Hydrotapsin our kitchen facilities, providing our employees with instant boiling and chilled water. This replaces the need to re-boiling kettles and reduces plastic waste from the previous water cooler unit refills. Respect Planet Boundaries OUR OFFICES RECYCLING & WASTE KITCHEN Our employees are provided with crockery and cutlery, as well as dishwashers in the kitchen areas to prevent the use of single use plastics. Many of our employees opt to bring in their own lunch using reusable pots from home WASTE We are expected to actively separate waste in clearly labelled rubbish bins, including paper, food, plastics and cardboard, collected and recycled by a third party waste management company. Obsolete electronic waste including computer equipment, TVs, printers etc. are all recycled, although we are investigating donation programs as an alternative. PRINTING We use recycled paper for our offices, however we are looking at alternative options for our current premium grade paper used for compliments slips and letterheads - currently not from recycled sources. Used printer toners and ink cartridges are recycled post use. CLEANING We use non harmful and specialised cleaning products to sanitise equipment between each production run and at the end of the shift, which reduces the amount of water required. Respect Planet Boundaries OUR MANUFATURING FACILITY RECYCLING & WASTE We set annual targets to reduce manufacturing waste through efficiencies in planning and processes, with the overall objective of reaching zero. We have an inhouse team who are working on a proposal to have the separation process on site although at moment we are limited on the space that we have and where we would store the recycled wate It is impossible to eradicate waste bulk product an although this is a very low volume for us we do recycle our liquid waste using a third party. They separate the water from any solids (from our lotions for example), generating electricity in the process Cardboard waste from the Manufacturing Facility such as corrugates/ packaging is compressed in-house prior to sending it to a 3rd party recycling plant We use non harmful and specialised cleaning products to sanitise equipment between each production run and at the end of the shift, which reduces the amount of water required 0ur \u201cReturn, Recycle, Reward\u201d Project will be piloted across some of our Stores and withi selected Hotel partners Respect Planet Boundaries OUR OFFICES AND MANUFATURING FACILITY REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT We have targets every year to continuously reduce our green house gas generation. There have been vast improvements related to optimisation of manufacturing schedules and improved cleaning processes which are helping us on that journey Although all of our energy is from carbon free sources, we have to use fuel to generate heat for the production of some of our products and heating of our offices. We are working on proposals to eliminate this requirement. Our transportation is handled by third party courier companies who are working on their own initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. It is difficult to overcome the need to fuel the vehicles. That said, we look at combining journeys all the time, to make every journey count We opt for sea freight to supply our global business, in preference to air freight wherever possible Our manufacturing plant is located in a rural area on a small industrial estate which does not have catering facilities on site. To prevent employees having to travel individually to get food, we have a family run local bakery which visits all the businesses on the Green Street (Elsenham) site We now manufacture Street (Elsenham) site two of our shampoos using cold mix processes, replacing hot mix which eliminates the need to heat the mixing vessels. We are looking at moving to this way of manufacturing across other product formats OUR OFFICES AND MANUFATURING FACILITY REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT ONLINE COMMUNICATION We provide conference calls with screen share facilities across all employee PCs/ Laptops to prevent unnecessary physical travel \u2013 this also allows us to keep in touch with our global colleagues on a regular basis. CAR SHARE We encourage our employees to car share where feasible \u2013 this works well at our manufacturing plant where many of our employees live in the same local areas.

Having reviewed our Gifting Proposition we still want to provide customers with an elevated Gifting offer. However, we do not want to over package our products, which is why we have removed the duo box from our Gifting Offer. Is it necessary to have so much tissue paper? We have worked to use the minimum amount of tissue paper, only a couple of sheets per box or bag. Our tissue paper is recyclable, biodegradable and compostable. You can dispose of the tissue in your food or green waste. What dyes are used on the boxes and bag \u2013 are these environmentally friendly? The dyes used on our boxes and bag are environmentally friendly. Are you not worried about sustainability? Light years ahead of our time, sustainability has been always been at the heart of Molton Brown. Our founders always used packaging which could be recycled easily and were among the first to be against animal testing. Today, we strongly believe Luxury and Sustainability go hand in hand, which is why this new Gifting Offer uses 15 tons less material than our previous packaging. In addition, our teams are working very hard to make this packaging even more sustainable for the future. Do you need to use plastic bags to wrap you candles/ aroma reeds/ Christmas gift boxes? Is the wrapper recyclable? To ensure your products arrive to you in pristine condition, we aim to package products carefully and securely to prevent marking or scuffing on your products. The plastic wrapping is not recyclable. The use of the plastic wrapping is currently under review Are the new boxes and bags recyclable? Our boxes are recyclable but you need to remove the magnet from the front of the box first. All of our bags are recyclable except the handles, which can be removed. We would advise you to re-use our boxes and bags as a beautiful storage solution rather than recycling. Are the ribbons recyclable? Unfortunately, at this stage our ribbons are not recyclable. We would advise you to re-use our beautiful ribbons as an adornment to any gift. We are looking at an alternative for the future. Why has the print on the boxes/tissue paper changed? As we aim to refine our Brand Experience to its very best, we have reworked our Gifting Boxes to align them with the look and feel of our new Fragrance Packaging. This still incorporates our signature Molton Brown Compass pattern. Why have you changed the duo box? You are a luxury brand; I expect the old style.

But what was his inspiration for the irresistible and iridescent Rose Dunes collection? Campaign Brand Pillars We use only the best ingredients in exceptional concentrations, which is also the case for the new Rose Dunes collection. For this fragrance, we have picked a blend of rose, saffron and sustainably-sourced patchouli to bring this fresh, yet warming and opulent element to the fragrance. Re-supporting our existing ESG achievements and commitments, we have worked closely with the suppliers of some of our natural materials to ensure their sustainability. The key signature note of the Eau de Parfum, Patchouli Sulawesi, has been sustainably sourced. You will learn more about this ingredient later. In an effort to reduce virgin materials, the Eau de Parfum sleeve contains 50% recycled materials. Passionate about Ambery fragrances and previously based in the Middle East, the perfumer, Philippe Paparella, has adopted a global interpretation on Middle Eastern ingredients and fragrances. Philippe has created a multifaceted fragrance that both resonates with Middle Eastern customers and has a large scale global appeal. Rose Dunes will truly be a blockbuster launch. A native from the South of France, his career started at the Mane Perfumer Training Program, before being posted in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2001. In 2003, Philippe moved to China, where he joined Symrise, a major producer of fragrances in May 2008. Since 2016, Philippe has been in Dubai. Philippe especially loves working with woody, ambery and musky notes for their sensual aspects. In Southeast Asia, he learned to work with exotic fruits such as mango and pineapple. He is always thrilled by the transformation of a written formula into an actual fragrance, bringing to life a strong feeling or emotion. Optimism is one of Philippe\u2019s qualities. He is passionate about life and has a keen interest in fashion and fitness. He does not shy away from trying new things and is heavily inspired by his own imagination... \"A picture or a word could lead me to imagine the flower I want to create. My imagination plays a very important role in my work, even more so than experiences.\" Facts About Philippe Paparella Apprentices are trained at the MANE School of Perfumery for a minimum of two years, during which they follow a thorough, customised programme. This programme endows the trainees with a profound knowledge of natural products, chemistry of perfumery and cosmetic ingredients along with the science of olfaction, all the while nourishing their unique and creative talent. Junior Perfumers complete their training \u201con the job\u201d, under the mentorship of a Senior Perfumer. Not only does Philippe enjoy travelling the world, he has also spent many years living in different locations from the South of France, Indonesia and Dubai. These cultural experiences have helped to inspire his approach to perfumery, whilst his ideas for scents come from his own imagination of a destination, or desired object. Philippe especially loves working with woody, ambery and musky notes for their sensual aspects. Woody notes: Earthy, Grounding and Clean Ambery: Sensual, Exoticism Musky: Gentle, Warm and Comforting The concept for Rose Dunes stemmed from a Desert Rose - which is an intricate rose-like formation of crystal clusters and are the only type of rose to be found in the desert. This rare, mystifying creation was Philippe Paparella's inspiration for Rose Dunes. Let us take a closer look at these elusive crystal formations... The crystal formations only occur in arid sandy conditions, and are formed from the combination of water, wind and sand merging in salt water basins. The water evaporates over thousands of years, leaving these beautiful crystal formations in the basins. These crystals are also the inspiration for the packaging design that you can see on the limited edition sleeve! A traditional Native American tale stated that Desert Rose Selenites were carved by warriors who returned home from the spirit world. The roses were said to have been spread across the Earth to protect these spirits\u2019 homeland. It is also considered an affirmation stone. Holding one, or keeping one close by is believed to bring feelings of self confidence and worth. Desert Roses form in many desert areas such as Saudi Arabia, Australia, Morocco, Mexico, and South Africa. Desert Rose is also sometimes called Gypsum Rose, Selenite Rose, Rose Rock, Gypsum Rosette, Selenite and Sand Rose.

This will help you to understand its olfactive profile and also give you ideas as to what other fragrances to suggest to your customer. Primary: Ambery - Defined as warm, opulent and mysterious, ambery fragrances are originally built around raw materials such as ambergris and musk, combined with woody, tobacco, spicy and marine facets. With access to synthetic ingredients, contemporary ambery perfumes are softer, usually featuring vanilla, labdanum, cinnamon, pepper or oudh accord. Secondary: Floral / Rose One of the most popular and ancient families in perfume history. As its name implies, flowers take centre stage to create a fragrant bouquet with blossoms such as rose, jasmine, violet, iris, lily, lily of the valley, narcissus or tuberose. Rose Dunes is classed as more of a Rose fragrance due to the prominence of both romantic rose and rose-like geranium. The Eau de Toilette is a celebration of rose with rich cassis that glistens at the top, softened by intimate saffron and velvety rose. The earthy-mossy base is deepened by patchouli and pulses of resinous amber. The Eau de Parfum is an addictive fragrance that is hypnotic. Fresh Madagascan pepper and ginger is wrapped by a dark bloom of rose. An addictive oudh accord awaits in the lingering base of sandalwood, musk and vetiver.

Stock should always be stored on shelving or in a safe area to avoid any trip hazards. - Stockrooms must be free from rubbish at all times. Boxes from a delivery must be broken down and then disposed of once the delivery has been completed. - If ladders are used in the stockroom make sure they are put away safely after use to avoid any health & safety risks. Stock Management The layout of the stockroom should be sectioned into product categories e.g. Bath & Body products together. If you are putting stock in to the stockroom always make sure it is placed in the correct area. - All boxes should be sealed with no loose stock. Loose stock can be placed in drawers and cupboards on the shop floor, making stock replenishment manageable. - If you are placing stock in the stockroom after completing a delivery, always put the boxes of stock you have had delivered towards the back of the relevant product category. This will ensure that the older batch codes are sold as a priority. - If you replenishing the drawers on the shop floor from the stockroom, always ensure you take or open boxes of stock from the front of the stockroom shelves. - Do not dump stock in random areas of the stockroom. Doing this will make items harder to locate and stock could be missed when counting at a stocktake. - Always notify a member of management if you notice a damaged product in the stockroom.

The need for packaging goes beyond its initial purpose, with customers wanting to repurpose the vessels and display them on shelves or coffee tables. Read the three key pillars below that helped guide us with the design of our Home Collection restage. More Than A Candle Luxury home fragrances are required to go beyond their first function with elevated packaging and reinvented formats to keep customers engaged. With this in mind, we decided to revamp our Home Collection with a timeless, sleek and minimal design that anyone would be proud to showcase in their home. Repurpose As more of us stayed at home due to lockdown demands, we were suddenly faced with the reality of how much waste we generate. Our new home collection's outer packaging has been massively reduced and the new design encourages customers to repurpose their vessels and do their part in reducing their environmental impact! From Office to Bedroom For the majority, switching off from working at home can be difficult. Finding ways to create a separation between work and home are limited. It is incredibly important to create a feeling of sanctuary and relaxation - and home scenting plays a huge part in being able to do this and transport us to other places and times! Our 3 key objectives Strengthen our Home Category through a new elevated design and home accessories with improved product & fragrance performance. Increase our category productivity by focusing our offer on best selling fragrances and covering key olfactive families for the Home Fragrance Category.

Having created some of the industry\u2019s most iconic scents including Guerlain\u2019s Samsara and Chanel\u2019s Cristalle, he is truly at the absolute epicentre of his craft.  His love of fragrance began at an early age when he spent his childhood summers in Grasse, picking jasmine flowers and learning about notes. Not afraid of taking risks, and keen to transcend fragrant stereotypes, he is truly an original perfumery trailblazer. His approach is instinctive and wildly creative. Jacques is passionate about the reconstruction of naturals. For him, tuberose, oakmoss and jasmine count as three of his most beguiling ingredients.  Jacques has been working with Molton Brown since 1993 and was the nose behind some of our most iconic original fragrances including Re-charge Black Pepper, Heavenly Gingerlily, Lime & Patchouli and Amber Cocoon. Jacques Individuality What was the inspiration behind Re-charge Black Pepper? Inspired by the bold spirit of adventure, vivacious citrus notes entwine with a spice-spiked breeze of warm, resinous black pepper and the confidence of lingering, earthy tones. Light violet leaf and coriander breathe brightness into dark, sensual vetiver for an iconic fragrance.\u201d - Jacques Chabert, Master Perfumer Re-charge Black Pepper - First Impressions Re-charge Black Pepper embodies the spirit of bold adventure.

Luxurious. Seafaring. Immersive. Perfumer - Philippe Bousseton Philippe Bousseton first came into contact with the world of fragrance when he was only five. His maternal grandfather was a perfumer. Attracted to working in perfume, he began to study chemistry. In 1971, he was one of the five students at ISIPCA, a perfumery school that had just opened. The school year was only just over when he joined Dana.  When the company closed in 1979, he went to work for Oril Fontarome. It was in 1982 that the doors really opened for him when he joined Takasago, a new name in the European world of fragrances, with Michel Almairac and Pierre Bourdon at the helm on the creative side of the business.  It was a fabulous period for Philippe Bousseton, who spent his time juggling between toiletries and perfumes. He got so used to it that it actually became his philosophy of life, one in which he finds pride, humility and joy. What was the inspiration behind Immersive Samphire & Eucalyptus? Our first fragrance brings together two Seabourn ports which are over 5000 miles apart.  The first stop \u2013 the French Atlantic coast. This beautiful coastline is home to a long seafaring tradition and gives us our first ingredient, Samphire.  Our second stop \u2013 China.

The matrix is deployed with a choice architecture profiling process that analyses customers and determines into which of the 87 different attitudinal and behavioural profiles they fit.

The process by which the final selection of fragrance is made for the customer is defined by the following three elements: - Stage One: Preference: in which we identify why the customer wears fragrance - Stage Two: Character: in which we determine what the customer's behavioural traits are - Stage Three: Mindset: in which we clarify how the customer prefers to receive information These three differentials help us to define: - The smell, style and type of product - The segmentation of the customer ", "146": "Title: Stage One: Preference ; Description: This initial stage identifies the right product category for the customer. This is based on existing research into the drivers behind our motivations for wearing fragrance. The three options are: Attraction, Articulation & Function. Preference: Attraction These customers' fragrance choices are motivated by seduction and provocation. They choose fragrances that are powerful, impactful and attractive to the opposite sex. For them, it is most important that a fragrance is strong and noticeable to others Preference: Articulation These customers' fragrance choices are motivated by comfort and feeling cocooned. They choose fragrances that are moreish and addictive, so much so that they just want to smell the scent all day. For them, it is most important that a fragrance is reassuring and conjures up emotional memories Preference: Function These customers\u2019 fragrance choices are motivated by feeling clean and fresh. They choose lightweight fragrances that enable them to feel like they have just stepped out of the shower. For them, it is important that a fragrance is not cloying or overpowering.

Character: Indulgent For these customers, shopping is all about fun. Their engagement with retail is about activities that are rewarding and life- affirming. They are busy customers, but nevertheless appreciate the finer things in life. When they can, they like to give themselves treats - the argument always being because I deserve it' Character: Balanced Product that is local falls into this category. It's about being friendly and engaging, understanding community and appreciating the bigger picture. These consumers are naturally active, body-aware and careful about their wellbeing.

The three choices are: Analytics, Expressive & Social. Mindset: Analytical Key factors here influencing design and tone of voice are the requirement to be factual, logical and detailed. For these customers, facts come first. They don't want fluff, but rather want to know what's inside the product. And they want that delivered in a manner that is clear, sensible and simple. Mindset: Expressive Here the product is defined and the customer influenced by the requirement to be cultural, authentic and romantic. These customers are very narrative-driven. They like to know the story behind stuff, and rant to find out who made . ex to did that magic eureka moment when they first discovered it. Mindset: Social This category is defined by an understanding of networks and social media. It\u2019s about being socially informed and knowing. These customers have a holistic approach and can combine both creative and the lateral. More connected than most, these customers are creative, collaborative connoisseurs who are into what is happening now.

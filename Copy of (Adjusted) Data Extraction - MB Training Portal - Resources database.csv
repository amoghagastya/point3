VIDEO TRANSCRIPT

Inspired by the bold spirit of adventure in the depths of the Madagascan Forests’ perilous mountain tracks. The result of one of our early and most iconic partnerships with the master perfumer Jacques Chabert,  our Re-charge Black Pepper collection is adventurous, energising and confident. Grown in Madagascar, black peppercorns unveil powerful, spicy and fruity flavours. It is a pepper that provides an outstanding finish, both sharp and refined. The pepper plant is a  vigorous vine with small green flowers grouped in long clusters, which give way to fleshy fruits of varying colours depending on maturity.


Black pepper, as we recognise it, is the full mature peppercorn, picked when tinged with red.  Several days of sun drying transforms these fleshy berries into shrivelled black kernels with a strong, spicy aroma. Re-charge black pepper has come to achieve iconic status because of its distinctive clash between bright citrus and deep woody notes.


When Jacques revisited our original re-charge black pepper collection in 2019 to begin the creation of our Eau de Parfum, it was the characteristic spiciness of the black peppercorns that really drew him to an ingredient that would amplify and enhance this bold warmth.  The ingredient Jacques selected was myrtle pepper. Myrtle pepper, otherwise known as all spice or pimento,  comes from the unripened berries of the evergreen pimento tree.


Robust and complex with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, it’s a spicy accent that adds a rich dimension to the overall fragrance."
Orange & Bergamot,"A Sevillian courtyard of sun-dappled citrus trees.

Signature. Radiant. Unmistakable.
Watch the video below to find out more about the iconic Orange & Bergamot:

VIDEO TRANSCRIPT

Inspired by the spirit of Seville, this radiant fragrance uses every element of the city’s famous orange tree. From the bright citrus fruit to the delicate neroli flowers and even the woody petitgrain. More than 14 thousand bitter orange trees decorate the Spanish streets and infuse Seville with the scent of their blossoms every spring. These ornamental bitter orange trees outnumber every other species of tree in the city

Originally known as Orange Grove, this collection has been at the heart of our portfolio since it was created by Michael Pickthall in 1984. Originally launched as one of the first luxury hand washes, Orange Grove saw instant success in hotels across the world. The launch of our unforgettable citrus fragrance was the true beginning of our hotel partnerships which, until this day, sees our products in five-star hotels across the globe.

In 2018, we partnered with master perfumer Beverley Bayne, a close friend of Michael Pickthall, to reinvent our Orange and Bergamot Collection. Our aim was to modernise this fragrance with contemporary ingredients whilst remaining true to Michaels original vision. In 2019 we once again sought Beverley’s creative expertise as we launched our very first collection of Eau de Parfum.

Beverley revisited the original inspiration for our iconic collection and staying true to the very heart of the fragrance, she selected a signature note of petitgrain. Petitgrain is steam distilled and extracted from the leaves and bark of the bitter orange tree. It takes around five hundred to six hundred kilograms of leaves to yield just one kilogram of petitgrain. It adds a fresh, green woodiness and entwines beautifully with the other orange tree elements, bringing depth and radiance to a classic collection.

Beverley describes our Orange and Bergamot Collection as a celebration of joy and energy with its enduringly happy aroma and true cult following, we couldn’t agree more."

VIDEO TRANSCRIPT

The black, sandy shorelines, luscious forests and a spicy perfume breeze, the perfect setting for our beautifully white, floral icon, Heavenly Gingerlily.

Heavenly Gingerlily is a warming, timeless fragrance which epitomises the exotic escapism of Polynesia. Blooming floral notes of tuberose, lily and rose are accompanied by warming ginger. Heavenly Gingerlily captures a sense of the exotic in an exquisite white floral. Tahiti’s warm sands, rich spices and beautiful island flowers being the inspiration.

The gingerlily flower known as Tahitian Flame, inspired the collections colour whilst the turquoise waters surrounding the heavenly destination are brought to life in the freshwater notes. Our Heavenly Gingerlily Collection is the creation of master perfumer, Jacques Chabert. A master perfumer in every sense, Jacques has an exhaustive and encyclopaedic knowledge of fragrance. His approach is instinctive and wildly creative.

Jacques is passionate about the reconstruction of natural ingredients, using a combination of ginger, lily and musk, to name but a few, Jacques began crafting an elegant, yet alluring, fragrance which quickly became an icon.

Eighteen years after its initial launch in 2001, Heavenly Gingerlily was revisited by Jacques and this time, the master of perfumery embarked on a new journey of discovery to find a unique signature note which would enrich and magnify the floral heart of our icon. Hyacinth was the perfect addition. Hyacinth is fresh and aquatic, yet opulent, with its sweet, floral notes and green undertones. It wraps around the aquatic, spicy character of the original scent to give it a more sensuous and distinctive signature.

Jacques had a desire to strengthen the white bloom of tuberose within the original fragrance and hyacinth allowed him to do just that. Its sensual quality elevates the classic floral threads of lily and rose to reveal a fragrance which is more polarising and intriguing than ever."
Fiery Pink Pepper,"Fiery Pink Pepper is an classic Molton Brown Icon.

Smouldering. Sultry. Stirring.
Inspired by pink peppercorns, also known as ‘Pink Gold of Reunion’ or ‘Grains of Paradise’, which are sourced from the volcanic terrains of Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean.

These tiny seeds are prized for their similarity in taste to black pepper, but have their own unique, complex
floral facets. The result is an unconventional, sensuous yet enlivening scent.

VIDEO TRANSCRIPT

Inspired by the grains of paradise, our Fiery Pink Pepper Collection is a sultry, warming fragrance which embodies the very spirit of the flamboyant pink peppercorn. Pink peppercorns are also known as the pink gold of Reunion Island. These tiny little seeds are prized for their similarity in taste to black pepper, yet they have floral attributes and aromas. Their amazingly complex flavour is that of pepper, coriander, ginger, cardamom, with a hint of citrus. The pink peppercorn is in fact not a peppercorn but a berry, sourced form the Peruvian pepper tree and dried.

Our Fiery Pink Pepper Collection is the creation of senior perfumer Carla Chabert. Carla has experimented with notes and accords since a young age. Using pink peppercorns sourced from the volcanic terrains of Reunion Island, Carla began crafting a spicy, rich fragrance which would soon become the perfect companion to our Re-charge Black Pepper Collection.

Nine years on from the launch of our Fiery Pink Pepper Collection in 2010, we once again requested the expertise of Carla as we began the journey to creating our very first Fiery Pink Pepper Eau de Parfum.

Through experimentation and vibrant pink inspiration, Carla sought an ingredient that was as bold and striking, in its natural form, as pink pepper. Osmanthus… this was the perfect addition. Bright, dramatic, and eccentric, osmanthus shares a rich, natural synergy and gives an apricot sweetness to pink pepper. Carla shares her thoughts on how osmanthus and pink pepper interact as she says, “Osmanthus is a sweet floral with a leathery kick that echoes the spiciness of the pink pepper”.

Delicious Rhubarb & Rose,"Delicious Rhubarb & Rose
A Molton Brown Icon
A just-baked slice of crimson spring tart.

Mouth-watering, bright grapefruit trickled over scattered petals of freshly picked, soft rose.

The tang of tart rhubarb leaf folded into a swirl of creamy vanilla for an utterly moreish touch.

Be irresistibly indulged; treat your senses to a delectably sweet recipe with a citrus twist.



Vivacious. Fizzy. Tempting

VIDEO TRANSCRIPT

Inspired by the sweetness of a crisp summer tart, our Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is a fizzy, tempting fragrance which symbolises the very essence of sharp Yorkshire rhubarb. Procured from January to late March, forced rhubarb is grown in the dark in the wonderfully named Rhubarb Triangle in Yorkshire.

Rhubarb is so beloved of northern gardens because the cool damp conditions produce the sweetest, most succulent storks. Whether baked into a mouth-watering dessert or simply dipped in sugar, rhubarb has a distinctively cheerful appearance and taste.

Our Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is the creation of senior perfumer Vanessa Prudent. Born in Normandy, Vanessa discovered an early passion for fragrance through nature. She has had the pleasure of travelling across the world and this is where she has found her biggest inspiration. Discovering new places evokes a curiosity, an emotion she uses in her perfumery.

Using rhubarb sourced from the luscious gardens of the Yorkshire Triangle, Vanessa began crafting an irresistible, floral fruity fragrance which would soon become a favourite of all who experienced it. Our Delicious Rhubarb and Rose Collection is a true floral fruity.

Rhubarb spikes a bitter top note as zesty fruits fizz with a citrus twist. These contrast with the sweetness of spun sugar in the base. Our gentle rose extract and vanilla bring to life the buttery pastry of a dessert."
Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel,"Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel is a true Molton Brown Icon.

Coastal. Venturesome. Uncharted.
A salt-sprayed collision of the ocean swell against rugged outcrops. The shore air fresh with crisp fig leaves mingled with unexpected, punchy cardamom, joyful bergamot and marine notes.

Bracing cypress, cedarwood and musks bring natural, earthy appeal.

Explore on the edge; awash your senses with a sea-soaked quest.

VIDEO TRANSCRPT
A rich interpretation of azure blue, our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Collection is a bracing, marine inspired fragrance which expresses the very essence of the rugged, ever-changing coastline.

Marine notes are accompanied by striking, naturally blue cypress oil. Blue cypress oil, sometimes referred to as blue gold, is similar to sandalwood oil and vetiver oil with long lasting, warm, woody base notes, and earthy tones. It combines well with lavender, lemon mrytle, citrus, and floral oils.

Our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Collection is the creation of senior perfumer Carla Chabert, the daughter of world-renowned master perfumer, Jacques Chabert. Her personal love affair with fragrance began as a child after she attended a client’s house with her mother. This hugely resonated with her, remembering the scents, textures, and perfume bottles of that particular meeting with deep affection.

Using a combination of blue cypress oil, marine notes, and cardamom, to name a few, Carla began crafting an uplifting, compelling fragrance which would soon gain iconic status. Just two years on from the launch of our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Collection, we once again requested Carla’s expert nose as we began the journey to creating our very first Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Eau de Parfum.

For Carla, the ingredient that was going to truly elevate our Coastal Cypress and Sea Fennel Eau de Parfum was the noble cardamom. Whilst cardamom is not a new addition to this collection, a heavy dose enhances the depth of the fragrance, highlighting the freshness on the top to add strength and vibrancy. For Carla, this overdose of cardamom was an instinctive choice and one which truly elevates our Eau de Parfum to a salt sprayed collision of ingredients."

Heavenly Gingerlily Collection Sheet,"Heavenly Gingerlily Exotic. Alluring. Escapist.
This bewitching, white-floral fragrance is one of our earliest and most
beloved collections. It began as a personal project for Master Perfumer
Jacques Chabert, after he visited a botanical garden and discovered
an exceptional ginger flower. Captivated by its heady, floral quality,
he combined it with aquatic notes and in doing so, put his own twist
on the 1990s marine perfume trend of the time. The result was a sensual
fragrance veiled with warm, spicy tones and exotic wanderlust.
Jacques initially named it ‘Gingerlily’ and we stayed true
to his vision, adding ‘Heavenly’ because this is exactly
the way this divine fragrance makes you feel.

Click FLIP on each image below to learn more about each of these pillars...


Quality
The new Christmas fragrance is an elegant take on the Fruity-Floral fragrance family, with a Molton Brown twist.

The ingredients used have a focus on sustainability as well as quality.

Sophisticated mimosa – a delicate, winter blooming flower with a global harvest of only 100-300kg per year is used in this collection. We have ensured that it is sustainably grown, harvested and produced.

These pillars play an important part in understanding this years Christmas collection and how & why it came to be.

Click FLIP on each image below to learn more about each of these pillars...


Wellbeing
Nostalgia plays a big part in this years Christmas campaign as people are turning to feelings of comfort to enhance a sense of well being after a turbulent period of unease. This will hopefully be the first Christmas in several years uninterrupted by the pandemic.

With this in mind, Molton Brown have considered nostalgic formulas and fragrances that bring back happy memories and support a feeling of comfort and wellbeing.


Togetherness
During the pandemic we saw an elevated trend towards Conscious Consumerism which continues to this day.

Customers are deliberately making purchasing decisions that they believe have a positive social, economic, and environmental impact. In short, it means shopping with sustainability in mind.


This was a big focus for our 2021 Christmas Campaign, and you will learn more about some of the ESG credentials and how they are clearly communicated to customers this year.



Finding joy
Last but not least, Molton Brown have also considered that the Merry Berries & Mimosa campaign should offer a celebratory and mischievous feel to put a smile onto customers faces!

At a time when the world feels a little precarious, we find comfort and hope in feelings of nostalgia and surrounding ourselves with our nearest and dearest to create new, happy memories together.

Fragrance Consultations,"Fragrance Consultations
As one of our Service Signatures, Fragrance Consultations are an illuminating way for customers to discover their favourite collections at Molton Brown.

Immersing our customers in the world of Molton Brown fragrances is done through two types of fragrance consultation.

The first you will likely be familiar with already, whilst the bookable or elevated service has been upgraded!

WALK IN
Available to customers who walk in to your store and show an interest in our fragrances:

5 -10 minutes Personality
Profiling Universal 
Profiling Refreshments 
BOOKABLE/ELEVATED
A more personal one-to-one consultation with dedicated time either bookable or in the moment, to fully immerse your customer in the olfactive world of Molton Brown:

15-20 minutes
Personality Profiling
Universal Profiling
Edutainment
Refreshments
Associated Hand & Arm Massage (If required)


Why do I need to carry out Fragrance Consultations?
At Molton Brown, it is an essential part of your job to be a brand ambassador for our fragrances and encourage your customers to experience them.

It is our mission to become recognised as a fragrance first retailer and the best way to do this is to invite customers to find their signature scent via a consultation.

Click on each image below to learn more about why you need to offer fragrance consultations:

Luxury Experience
Many of our competitors are seen as fragrance retailers before anything else, such as Jo Malone and Penhaligons.

So how do we become Fragrance First?

To do this, we need to actively invite our customers to experience these wonderful fragrance collections, and a professional, fun and complimentary consultation is one way in which we can achieve this.

Consistent Service
We want to ensure that whether a customer walks into one of our Molton Brown stand alone stores in the United Kingdom, or a Molton Brown concession in Australia, the services delivered are as consistent in consultation technique and experience as possible in order to support you in achieving your fragrance targets.

KPIs
Offering these elevated services is a great way for Molton Brown to distinguish ourselves against our competitors, providing a unique and immersive customer experience.
The more renowned Molton Brown become as a fragrance first retailer, the more customers will come to us for their signature scent. This will result in more opportunities for you to grow you KPI's and achieve your sales targets.



Setting the scene means to create the conditions in which something can happen.

It is crucial to creating a great First Impression for your customers, whether it is a Walk In Fragrance Consultation or a Bookable/Elevated fully immersive experience.

Ensuring we are fully prepared for the day will ensure smooth service for the customer and yourself!

Follow the steps below to setting the scene:


Location
Consider the locations you can host your consultations.

Walk-Ins are usually on the shop floor in front of a fragrance destination bay, capsule or table.

Bookable/Elevated consultations can be carried out either sat down at the Hub, or in a dedicated consultation area in your store if you have the space.

Ensure each area is clean and bottles are in pristine condition as this provides a luxurious environment for your customer.


Blotters & Juice
At the start of each day, ensure that your dedicated fragrance area has the correct testers on display and that there is enough fragrance ""juice"" in each bottle. It would be quite embarrassing if a customer wanted to try a fragrance only to discover it is empty!
Blotters enable you and your customer to smell the fragrances at the same time as they discover it. If your store is running low, speak to your manager who will be able to order more on the next consumable order.
Sometimes, we may face a shortage of branded blotters, but Retail Operations will communicate how to order alternatives.

Technology
When using the Fragrance Finder Tool on the shop floor, or in a dedicated consultation area - make sure that the iPad is fully charged and the most recent updates have been installed for both the device and the Fragrance Finder App.

When the iPad is not in use, get into the habit of putting it on charge either at the till point or in the office so that it is ready to use whenever it might be needed.

The Fragrance Finder Tool may show discontinued fragrances due to the app not being updated, or, a delay removing them due to coding issues.

Ensure you have strong product knowledge to overcome any potential ouch!


Refreshments
If you are offering your customers the choice of a refreshment, please ensure that you have it available to serve. Having the correct glasses also helps to create a luxurious first impression.



Tea:

Are there enough tea bags?

Do you need sugar?

Do you have an in-date milk/non-dairy alternative?



Coffee:

A step-by-step of the fragrance finder tool:
Step Five
The fragrance finder will match the customer to three fragrances. Scroll through on the tool to discover what they are.

1.Your perfect match is…

Use the text on screen to reveal a few key notes in the fragrance and spray it on a blotter for a customer to try.



2. You might also like…

Even if the customer loves the first fragrance offered, keep the conversation light hearted and let them try this alternative also.
It’s good to have something to make a comparison with to find out what we truly love!

3. You might also like…

A final third fragrance will be suggested – this is usually from the same fragrance family, however the tool has been known to pull a wild card to liven up the conversation!



When hosting a consultation with the fragrance finder tool, it is quite easy to standby and let the customer complete the questions on the device in silence.


This isn't the immersive, pleasurable interaction we want our customers to experience in our stores!


We must help guide our customers with the images that appear on screen whilst continuing to build rapport with them.

Fragrance Finder Top Tips

Click on each image below for a great top tip when using the fragrance finder tool with your customer.


Sometimes a customer will like all three of the fragrances that the tool has recommended they try, they then have difficulty choosing their favourite one.

Here is a top tip to help you deliver a wonderful experience to your customer:

Out of the 3 fragrances, ask them what they think is their absolute favourite.

Look for cues such as how they talk about it, if their facial expressions change drastically, or their tone of voice changes – these are all behaviours that we don't consciously realise that we are demonstrating when we like or dislike something.

Ask your customer to imagine a comfortable room with no windows or doors. They have to be in this room for 24 hours with only this scent to accompany them. Which one out of the three would they choose to be with?

This task, whilst it seems strange, really helps the customer to focus their attention on a fragrance they enjoy the most rather than the selection.


There will be occasions that the fragrance finder makes fragrance suggestions and your customer does not like any of them.

Don’t panic!

The Fragrance Finder Tool is very smart, it has hundreds of combinations and possible results it works with – however, we don’t always agree with what it might suggest. It is artificial intelligence after all!

Ask your customer what it is about each fragrance they do not like… it could be the fragrance family, a particular note or even the ‘depth’ (EDT or EDP) of a fragrance.

Continue asking our Universal Profiler Questions to help the customer navigate the other collections and find their perfect fragrance.


our customer says that they would like to treat themselves to one of our fragrances the tool has suggested.

How exciting!

The conversation that follows can seem a little daunting or rushed depending on your confidence in closing the sale.

You should have asked during the consultation, one of our Universal Profiler Questions: What's important to you when buying a fragrance?

They will likely have said, ""I want it to last a long time"".

If your customer has time (and you do too), invite them over to the hub to experience the benefits of layering with a matching or complementing body lotion and Bath & Shower Gel.

They may say ""no thank you"" to an experience at the hub.

No worries, guide your customer to the till to beautifully wrap their purchase and offer them a sample of another fragrance they liked if you have them in stock.




Matching fragrance families to personality types
Menu
Generally speaking, each of us is drawn to a particular fragrance family because of the way that is makes us feel.

Fragrances are an outward projection of our personalities and help us to present ourselves to the world in a particular way...

Activity
Imagine you are in an elevator on your own.

The doors open and a person joins you on the journey for a matter of seconds before they get off at their floor – you only spend a few moments in their company and assess what they look like: height, identity, race, style and defining features.

You notice that the person is impeccably dressed in business attire and is quite attractive in their appearance.

Your brain is also processing what this stranger smells like, probably without even being aware that you are doing this.

Imagine that this stranger in beautiful tailoring, clean cut and presentable smells musty and like damp clothing.

Your initial reaction is probably a little bit of confusion...

This is because our limbic system and brain relies on memories and associations linked to people who present themselves in this way. If the scent we are picking up on doesn't match this visual cue, it gives us an uncomfortable sensation!

Generally, the choice of scent we choose should reflect our personality and sense of style.

This is why we ask our customers to describe their personality and style to us as it helps us gain an understanding of who they are.

However, some people do like to step out of their comfort zone with the choice of fragrance they choose to wear.

Most people though do give away clues as to what types of fragrance families would best be suited to them.

Click on the hotspots below to learn about four of the fragrance families:

HotspotHotspotHotspotHotspot
There are two other fragrance families at Molton Brown...

Can you identify what they are and who you believe they would be best suited to?

Write your answers in your fragrance diary, or, on a poster to display back of house for your team members to study.

Hand & Arm Massage Ouches,"Hand & Arm Massage Ouches
There are several ""Ouches"" that you might encounter when offering a Molton Brown Hand & Arm Massage services to your customers.

However, we want to assure you that there are plenty of ways to ""Eliminate those Ouches!""

Click on each image below for more detailed information:

The Pandemic
Some customers may not feel ready to experience a Hand & Arm Massage. That's fine - reassure them that they can book the service in the future once they are feeling more relaxed and comfortable with the idea.

You can also discuss the Me Time Hand & Arm Massage where you can match and mirror your customer by conducting a Hand & Arm Massage with them at the hub. We will go over how you can offer this service to your customers later in this module.


No Time
One of the Ouches we hear often is that it is too busy in store or there isn't enough time to conduct a Hand & Arm Massage. This tends to be the case for Outlets and Wholesale stores. However, we have come up an express, 'no water, no problem' Hand & Arm Massage. This can be conducted in any location to surprise and delight your customers.

Similarly, the Hand & Arm Massage is broken down into steps and techniques so you can adapt it to the amount of time you and your customer has.


Technique
One common Ouch is that we may be reluctant to carry out a Hand & Arm Massage as we are unsure of the correct techniques to use to effectively conduct the massage. This can be unsettling for you and for your customer.

You will get a full breakdown of the Hand & Arm Massage techniques with videos and additional tools to support you when offering and carrying out these service signatures.


Gender
We understand that at times some customers may feel uncomfortable receiving a Hand & Arm massage from a member of the perceived opposite sex, but there are ways around this. Do not feel offended - it could be because of somebodies religious beliefs or personal experiences.

Ask the customer if they feel comfortable to proceed with you, and if they don’t... You can see if another member of the team is available to conduct the service.

In addition to the common Ouches in our stores, you may have your own personal reasons for not wanting to conduct a Hand & Arm Massage.

Personal Ouches

The Pandemic 
You may feel that you are not ready to complete a hand & arm massage. That may be the case but we still need to make our customers aware that we have now introduced this service experience and it is available when they feel ready to do so. There are currently no regulations preventing cosmetic or beauty treatments from taking place.

Please discuss with your line manager if you need additional support.	


Gender
We understand that at times some customers may feel uncomfortable receiving a Hand & Arm massage from a member of the opposite sex and similarly there may be members of the team who feel uncomfortable too. There are ways around this. If you feel uncomfortable to proceed with a service - then speak to your manager discreetly and maybe partner up with someone to share the role of conducting a Hand & Arm Massage.
Confidence 	


Ouches Eliminated
One of the most common ouches is that individuals within a team are reluctant to carry out a hand & arm massage as they are unsure if they are doing the service correctly and using the right technique.

By completing this learning and practicing the techniques regularly in your store with colleagues will ensure that you build your confidence.

There might be other ouches that you can identify. Discuss these with your line manager so that they can provide you with the tools you need to eliminate them.

WOW with Technique,"Hand & Arm Massages
Menu
Click on each arrow below to discover the techniques for each type of Hand & Arm Massage experience:

Walk In Hand & Arm Massage
Watch the video below to understand step-by-step the techniques used during a Walk In Hand & Arm Massage.

Once you have watched the video, practice with a fellow team member to develop your skills.

A Walk-In Hand & Arm Massage should last 5-10 minutes.

During a Walk-In experience, you will massage and demonstrate our products on only one of the customers arms. This enables the customer to see and smell the benefits of layering products.

If your customer has loved their experience, they will most likely ask you to do their other arm too! This is a good thing - it means they are happy and are likely to purchase.

If both you and they have time, conduct the Hand & Arm Massage on their other arm too.

Video Player


As you would have seen in the video, the 'Up and Over Technique' in the Nourish step can look a little simple unless done correctly.

Below shows you how to apply pressure with your fingers and thumb when completing this technique to ensure an effective massage is given to the customer.



When you are working your way up the arm, apply pressure to the outside of the arm with your four fingers. Imagine your hand is like a claw. Your entire palm and fingers should be in contact with the customers arm at all times.



When you are working your way down the arm, apply pressure with your thumb down the other side of the arm. This will ensure all aspects of the muscle are massaged.



The video below helps demonstrate this...




Bookable/Elevated Hand & Arm Massage
Watch the video below to understand step-by-step the techniques used during a Bookable/Elevated Hand & Arm Massage.

This technique can also be used during events, layered with Edutainment.

Once you have watched the video, practice with a fellow team member to develop your skills.

A Bookable/Elevated Hand & Arm Massage should last 10-20 minutes.

Ensure you conduct the experience on only one of your customers arms first to allow them to see and smell the benefits of layering products. Once you have done this, complete the Cleanse, Exfoliate, Nourish and Fragrance on the customers other arm too.

Video Player


To read the step by step Hand & Arm Massage Guide for an elevated or Bookable experience, click the download button.

We have also provided you with a glossary for all of the techniques mentioned so you can study and practice these and keep them for future reference in your staff file.


No Water? No Problem!
We mentioned previously that not having running water or a hub might be an ouch for conducting a Hand & Arm Massage... however at Molton Brown, all customers should have the chance to receive a luxury service, regardless of which store they enter!

To help those who do not have a hub or running water, we have created a video to show you how you can still conduct a Hand & Arm massage.

Luckily, the technique is exactly the same for everyone so there is nothing new to learn! Just the products are amended to suit what you have available in your location.

Hand & Arm Massages Last Impressions,"Last Impressions
Menu
Creating a fantastic lasting impression is one of the FLOW philosophies you will be familiar with.

Delivering a great lasting impression can be a deciding factor as to whether the customer will shop with you again or not, and isn't necessarily carried out in the final moments spent with your customer. Always be aware of what you say and do throughout the customers journey.

Below we outline a few examples of how to deliver a positive lasting impression during a Hand & Arm Massage:

Passion

Being knowledgeable about or products is one thing, but being passionate about them and your role at Molton Brown is what customers will really connect with and remember!



Always find the positive in a fragrance collection or product, even if it isn't your personal favourite. Our role as fragrance experts is to encourage customers to express themselves.


Engaged
We know at times your stores are busy and you might even be short staffed. You may have a delivery to process or an unexpected visit from your Area Manager

But remember...
The Customer Comes First.

If a customer has booked in for an experience, ensure that everything is done in your control to stay engaged with them, build rapport and continue to stay connected to ensure they get the most from the service you are conducting.

We do not want our customers to feel like they are getting in the way!


Top Tips
Customers love to learn something new - whether that is a technique that they can perform themselves at home or learning something fascinating about our heritage.
This is the difference between a scripted service and a personal service - share your top tips with your customers during a Hand & Arm massage using the edutainment tools as your reference.


Now that you have seen some examples of things to consider to deliver a fantastic lasting impression with your customers...


What other ways can you create a fantastic Lasting Impression?

Hand & Arm Massages First Impressions,"First Impressions
Menu
Hand & Arm Massage - First Impressions
Whether your customer is a new or regular Molton Brown shopper, offering them a Hand & Arm Massage is an excellent way to establish rapport and a fantastic first impression.

Did you know?
Touch creates symbolic connections between people and products, and between buyers and sellers.

Physically holding products can create a sense of psychological ownership, driving must-have purchase decisions!

There are various customer types that you will encounter on any given day.

We have identified four common customer types and how you can offer both a walk in and bookable/elevated Hand & Arm massage to them.

Click on each image below to learn more:


""I know what I want""
Just because this customer says they know what they want - doesn't mean they wouldn't be interested in trying a product on their skin, or experiencing other collections they might enjoy.

This customer type can sometimes come across quite dismissive - Perhaps it could be because of time constraints or because they have been sent in to purchase a product for someone else.

A good way to get around this is to start the conversation with some of the words below:

""I can see...""

""Did you know...""



For example:

""I can see you are stocking up on our Re-charge Black Pepper B&SG. Did you know, this collection now includes an Eau de Parfum and Eau de Toilette, do you have 5 minutes to try it for yourself?""

(If your customer is male, keep it simple and introduce the fragrance as an aftershave)



Simply asking your customer if they have a few minutes to try a product on their skin could result in them actually spending more time with you and increases the chances of them making a purchase!

If they don't have the time, this is when you can use one of your Bounce Back Invitations to invite them in again when they have more time to indulge.

""I need some help""
These are fantastic customers!

As they have expressed that they need some help or advice from you, they are generally more willing to spend time experiencing the products and listening to what you have to tell them.

This is the perfect time to utilise the Universal Profiling Questions!

Once you have established their needs using our UPQ's, ask the customer, ""Why not take the opportunity to indulge in a decadent Hand & Arm Massage? It is the perfect way to experience our products""

Listen closely to any exciting event opportunities a customer might drop into conversation such as upcoming birthday's, weddings etc. as you could potentially host a bespoke VIP event for this customer and boost your KPI's!

""I'm just browsing""
Browsing customers can generally come across as quite abrupt and dismissive towards you.

Sometimes a customer is browsing just to pass time whilst they are waiting for somebody or something. Other times they might be browsing to get gift ideas for themselves or others, but one fact remains, they have walked into your store for a reason. Don't miss a potential sales opportunity!

This is another opportunity to engage with a Universal Profiler Question such as

""What do you know about Molton Brown?""

This opens up the doors of possibility to find out if they have used and experienced our products before. Why not say: ""Just to let you know I am available to deliver a Hand & Arm Massage today and introduce you to our Molton Brown fragrance collections and their benefits""

""I'd like a fully immersive experience""
Fantastic!

These customers are fanatics about Molton Brown and would probably be part of your team if they could! They have a wealth of knowledge of past and current collections and love nothing more than getting to be amongst the first to experience and buy new collections.

Fully immersive customers make themselves known by taking products to the basins to try, using the fragrance testers and usually ask about our services.

Invite these customers to enjoy an elevated Hand & Arm Massage if they have the time - highlighting that they have been significantly elevated.

As these customers love to feel extra-special, why not handwrite them an invitation to an upcoming store event or an elevated Fragrance Consultation?



Setting the scene means to create the conditions in which something can happen.

It is crucial to creating a great First Impression for your customers, whether it is a quick 5-10 minute Hand & Arm Massage or a bookable/elevated fully immersive experience.

Ensuring we are fully prepared for the day will ensure smooth service for the customer and yourself!

Follow the steps below to setting the scene:

Testers



Are your product testers suitably full for use?

There is nothing worse than trying to showcase a product that is nearly empty!

Make sure all testers are ready to be used by your team and customers at the start of each day.

If another tester needs to be created, speak to a member of management.





Water & Basins



At the start of each day, ensure that there is hot water running to the basin sinks*.

If not, raise this with a manager to ensure it is fixed.

If your basins do not have hot water, not to worry - half fill them with cold water and mix with warm water from the taps back of house.

Remember to run taps for 5 minutes each day to eliminate the potential of legionella.

*Only applicable to stores with basins.


Towels



Whether you are using paper napkin towels or premium cotton towels, ensure that you have enough in stock and laundered ready for use each day.

Towels should look and feel luxurious - even paper napkins.

If you need more paper napkins, please speak to your manager who will be able to order more.



Refreshments



If you are offering your customers a refreshment, ensure that you have the drink available to serve them and that it is chilled - there is nothing worse than warm bubbly!

Remember to ask your customer if they have any dietary requirements so that you can check for them on the ingredients on the side of the bottle.

Usually, most customers are quite content with a glass of still or sparkling water, or even a cup of coffee.

Consider your staff in store - can you leave the shop floor for several minutes to fetch a cup of coffee? Only offer what is feasible for a seamless customer experience.



Techniques



Finally, you need to ensure that you have practiced and are confident in the techniques used to differentiate between a walk-in Hand & Arm Massage to those used in a bookable/elevated experience.

We want you to feel positive about carrying out every Molton Brown Service Signature with your customers.

If after this module you still feel you require additional support, speak to your manager who will guide you through the techniques.


Before you begin your Hand & Arm Massage, walk your customer through the collections asking them a series of Universal Profiler Questions to identify their needs. Through this you can determine which collections to introduce and use whilst carrying out the Hand & Arm Massage.

Click each button below to learn about other ways to help set the scene:

Prepare the Hub



Once you have selected the products with your customer, ensure that they are open and ready to be used throughout the service.

Top tip: Position the products in a line in the order you are going to apply them to your customers skin.

Ensure you have a full supply of paper towels to use. Be prepared and unfold two paper towels before you start the service


Fragrance Arc



Before you begin delivering the Hand & Arm Massage with your customer, Let them know you are going to place a towel over their lap for protection.

Spray an arc of the chosen Eau de Parfum or Eau de Toilette in a halo above the hub. This will gently scent the space and fully immerse yourself and the customer in olfactive bliss.


Jewellery



If you or your customer are wearing jewellery such as rings or bracelets, we do advise that you politely ask them to be removed.

Product such as the body polisher can get caught in any grooves and you could catch the palm of your hands on any sharp edges.

Suggest to your customer that they place their items on a napkin in front of them to keep a close eye on, or of course, they can put their belongings in their bag for safe-keeping.

If you are wearing rings, store them safely until after the service is complete.

Service Signatures Introduction,"
Molton Brown Service Signatures
Hello Knapper,Jonathan

Welcome to the Molton Brown Service Signatures training module - A training module here to provide you with all of the information, tools and techniques to delivering a fantastic Molton Brown Experience in store.

Those that have attended the workshops, this training module will help support you with your team training on our service signatures in store, therefore, this is a supporting course only and is non-mandatory.

Take it at your own pace and use the menu in the top right corner to focus on the areas you really need to work on. There is no requirement to complete 100% of this module.

We look forward to seeing all stores conducting the new Service Signatures and really elevating that Molton Brown Experience.


Why are we elevating our Service Signatures?


At Molton Brown we want to elevate and enhance our current service signatures to further establish our credentials as a truly experiential and luxury brand.

An overview of the elevated Service Signatures
The world of retail has changed rapidly in the past couple of years, with customers drawn to a more experiential retail environment. To ensure that we stay relevant amongst our competitors in the market, we have elevated our service signatures. From Hand & Arm massage techniques to fragrance consultations we have ensured these experiences are memorable and encourage Customer Lifetime Value.

Click on each icon below to learn more about some of the elevated changes:



Hand & Arm Massages
We have completely revamped our Hand & Arm Massages which have been adapted for both time-conscious walk-in customers and those looking for an indulgent treat via a bookable service.

For those of you who have been with Molton Brown for a while, you will undoubtedly notice some of the different ways in which we have elevated these experiences.



Fragrance Consultations
As part of our mission to be recognised as a fragrance first retailer, we have reviewed our current fragrance consultation proposition and re-worked it to include a blend of education and entertainment to enhance the customers experience. We have also provided YOU with some exciting tools to achieve this.




Edutainment
What is Edutainment?

Edutainment is a method to entertain whilst educating our customers on our products, our brand and provides them with a fully immersive experience that showcases your skills and your knowledge of Molton Brown.

We have created a set of tools covering everything from our heritage, sustainability credentials, iconic products and even how the sense of smell works. Each tool is broken down into small points to enable bite size learning.

We know that our customers love to experience our products but also learn about them too - remember, it is the benefits of a product that helps to sell it!



Events
In-store events and activities are incredibly important to encourage customer interaction, sales growth and customer life time value.

We have in the past focused on hosting events only when new products are released. To relinquish our dependence on new collections, we have reviewed our eventing proposition so that you are empowered to host an event with any iconic collection, whenever you choose.



Why do I need to know about the elevated Service Signatures?
As an employee of Molton Brown, it is an essential part of your job to deliver the FLOW philosophy with every customer that walks into your store.

This includes conducting Hand & Arm Massages and Fragrance Consultations.

This helps to build brand trust and loyalty and ensures that we are continually recognised as a luxury brand.

Click on each image below to learn more about why you need to actively promote the Molton Brown Service Signatures:

Luxury Experience

Offering your customer the opportunity to enjoy an indulgent hand & arm massage to learn about and experience our products is the pinnacle of luxury service.


Consistent Service

We want to ensure that whether a customer walks into one of our stand alone stores, an outlet or even a wholesale door, the experiences delivered are as consistent in technique as possible.


This will also help you build your confidence in delivering the various techniques required for each of the services.


KPIs

Of course, whilst offering luxurious services to our customers to enjoy, our products help to set us apart from some of our competitors - they are also a sales technique to help boost our KPIs.

Once a customer gets to feel and experience the product on their skin, they have made a physical connection to the product and begin to desire them once they understand the benefits and value of each product used.

Fragrance Deconstructed,
Rose Dunes Summary,
Do you want to be remembered,
The Rose Dunes Collection,"Discover the Ambery Floral Fragrance Family
Let's identify which primary and secondary fragrance families that Rose Dunes belongs to.

This will help you to understand its olfactive profile and also give you ideas as to what other fragrances to suggest to your customer.

Click on each cross below to learn more.

Primary - Ambery
Defined as warm, opulent and mysterious, ambery fragrances are originally built around raw materials such as ambergris and musk, combined with woody, tobacco, spicy and marine facets. With access to synthetic ingredients, contemporary ambery perfumes are softer, usually featuring vanilla, labdanum, cinnamon, pepper or oudh accord.


Secondary - Floral/Rose
One of the most popular and ancient families in perfume history. As its name implies, flowers take centre stage to create a fragrant bouquet with blossoms such as rose, jasmine, violet, iris, lily, lily of the valley, narcissus or tuberose.

Rose Dunes is classed as more of a Rose fragrance due to the prominence of both romantic rose and rose-like geranium.


Using your knowledge of our fragrances and the families, what other fragrance could you suggest to your customer if they like Rose Dunes?
Please select one fragrance below:


Mesmerising Oudh Accord & Gold


Coastal Cypress & Sea Fennel


The Eau de Toilette is a celebration of rose with rich cassis that glistens at the top, softened by intimate saffron and velvety rose.


The earthy-mossy base is deepened by patchouli and pulses of resinous amber.



The Eau de Parfum is an addictive fragrance that is hypnotic.

Fresh Madagascan pepper and ginger is wrapped by a dark bloom of rose. An addictive oudh accord awaits in the lingering base of sandalwood, musk and vetiver.

Fragrance Facts
Concentrations
Flip
The Eau de Parfum contains 20% fragrance oil meaning that it will last on a persons skin for up to 8 hours. For added longevity, explain the benefits of layering with the matching body lotion.



The Eau de Toilette is much lighter by design and is meant to be applied liberally for an instant ambery top-up!


Notes

There are two notes that are important for different reasons in the fragrance collection.



Signature note - Patchouli Sulawesi

Perfumer Philippe has overdosed the Patchouli note for added depth, sensuality and earthiness in the Eau de Parfum.



Overarching note - Rose

The rose note used throughout the entire collection is rich, velvety and romantic.


Resin Cap

he unique resin cap design is inspired by the rich colours found in a sunset over the sand dunes of the Arabian desert.

"Home restage
The NEW Home Fragrance Collection","From candles to aroma reeds - our new Home Collection is filled with beautiful, scented objects as elegant as they are expertly created, we’ve thought of every little detail to transform your house into a sanctuary.



Our Scented Candles and Aroma Reeds have been carefully reformulated with higher fragrance concentrations for an exceptional experience.

These come in a selection of our best-loved, award-winning Fragrances to set an uplifting, refreshing or relaxing ambience.



Let's discover why scenting our homes has become more important than ever...

The Home Sanctuary


In 2020, due to the pandemic, much of the world suddenly had to adapt to a new way of working - with many people working from their homes instead of office environments.

Because of this, an increasing number of people wanted to make their home a comfortable sanctuary to live and work in.

In August 2020, The Times newspaper reported that candle sales at Selfridges increased by 54% since March 2020, while candle sales at Diptyque increased by 100% year on year.

With a new way of working here to stay, we anticipate the demand for beautifully scented spaces to continue to grow...



Below are some interesting statistics on fragrance and home scenting that were a direct result of the impact of COVID-19 restrictions.

56% of consumers took comfort in scents more than they did before Covid-19 lockdowns!

The pandemic resulted in fewer occasions for personal fragrances to be worn, but increased the demand for home fragrances.

The demand for home scenting increased drastically, with consumers happy to spend considerable sums on candles & aroma reeds to scent their homes with.




With the increasing popularity to showcase objects of desire on social media, combined with spending more time at home, consumers are drawn to items that are aesthetically pleasing as well as practical for their purpose.

The need for packaging goes beyond its initial purpose, with customers wanting to repurpose the vessels and display them on shelves or coffee tables.



Read the three key pillars below that helped guide us with the design of our Home Collection restage.

More Than A Candle

Luxury home fragrances are required to go beyond their first function with elevated packaging and reinvented formats to keep customers engaged.

With this in mind, we decided to revamp our Home Collection with a timeless, sleek and minimal design that anyone would be proud to showcase in their home.

Repurpose

As more of us stayed at home due to lockdown demands, we were suddenly faced with the reality of how much waste we generate.

Our new home collection's outer packaging has been massively reduced and the new design encourages customers to repurpose their vessels and do their part in reducing their environmental impact!

From Office to Bedroom

For the majority, switching off from working at home can be difficult.

Finding ways to create a separation between work and home are limited. It is incredibly important to create a feeling of sanctuary and relaxation - and home scenting plays a huge part in being able to do this and transport us to other places and times!

Our 3 key objectives
Strengthen our Home Category through a new elevated design and home accessories with improved product & fragrance performance.

Increase our category productivity by focusing our offer on best selling fragrances and covering key olfactive families for the Home Fragrance Category.

Continue building our ESG (Environmental Social Governance) credentials through sustainable packaging and refillable solutions.

This rich, woody-aromatic scent marks the pinnacle of our 50th year celebrations, capturing decades of festive joy, which all began at our South Molton Street salon in London, 1971.

Hair Care Collection Library,"Hair Care
We have a proud heritage of creating natural hair care in our original 1970s Mayfair salon. Our pioneering founders had a forward-thinking, holistic approach to hair styling with a conscious care for the environment. Our fragrant formulas are targeted to suit all hair types and elevate a normal routine. Our new Botanical Hair Care (2021) contains sustainably sourced herbs: nettle, camomile, fennel and coriander. Paying homage to our home, London, we chose to grow our ingredients in once-abandoned underground tunnels, using remarkable hydroponic systems and LED technology. This means they’re produced year-round in a controlled, pesticide-free environment, unaffected by weather and seasons. Using 70% less water than a traditional farm, this method keeps all nutrients in a closed loop system to reduce agricultural runoff. Plus, our packaging is made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic.

Pioneer Sustainable Lifestyles We will create a new definition of a luxury lifestyle, one that is uncompromising when it comes to the planet.

OUR PRODUCTS
SUSTAINABLE
SOURCING
SUSTAINABLE
FORMULATIONS
• Our suppliers have to be members of SEDEX, one of the Worlds leading ethical trade and service providers, (or similar organisations) to ensure that they operate in a sustainable and ethical way.
• Many of our ingredients are chemicals which are derived from other natural resources or are synthesized where a “sustainability certification” is not available or required.

SUSTAINABLE
FRAGRANCES
Pioneer Sustainable Lifestyles
We will create a new definition of a luxury lifestyle, one that is uncompromising when it comes to the planet.

PRODUCT
• As a company, we are continuously innovating formulations. We use a combination of mineral oil and vegetable oil to create our Body & Bathing Oils.
• We aim to deliver sustainablefragrances either through responsibly sourced natural ingredients or via traceable synthetic raw materials, which are environmentally and ecologically friendly.
• We are continuing to review the viscosity of our formulations to make them more fluid and easier to use. This will reduce the leftover product in the packaging and therefore less in the overall production. This will reduce waste product in landfill and making it easier to recycle the packaging.
• Producing anhydrous (product that do not require water) single use formulations for our travel collections and hotel amenities range are in the early stages of development.
• Our fragrances are a combination of natural, nature identical and synthetic ingredients. We are always looking for fragrances and ingredients from more sustainable sources.
• We continue to face the challenge to find ingredients that are fully sustainable, and still deliver the same sensorial fragrance experience that our customers know and love.
• Feasibility studies are underway to understand the possibility of having fragrances completely based on natural, renewable resources. We are currently at the very beginning of this journey

SUSTAINABLE
MANUFACTURING
• We manufacture our products in the UK, the majority of which are made in our own Manufacturing Facility, in Green Street, Elsenham.
• Soap Bars, products that contain suspended particles, or alcohol based products, require specialised machinery and are therefore manufactured in an alternative third party UK Manufacturing Facility.
• Our hotel accessories are sourced outside of the UK.
• We are investigating the feasibility of manufacturing shampoos and conditioners in a solid form.
• Moving more formulations to 2 x cold mix manufacturing processes to eliminate the need to use heating and reduce carbon footprint – a realistic target for Molton Brown with testing, is ongoing.

SYNTHETIC COLOURANTS, PARABENS & CONTROVERSIAL INGREDIENTS
In line with current legislation, Molton Brown products adhere to governing bodies to ensure all of the products are fit for purpose and are safe to use before we release them for general sale. Synthetic colourings are used to provide the vibrancy and array of colours that are enjoyed across our collections. All colorants are water soluble and approved as per the Regulations of the countries we distribute to Microplastcis are insoluble or bio persistent and are an intentionally manufactured material with one or more external dimensions, or an internal structure. We have recently formulated our men’s African Face Scrub to remove Microplastics and are completing thorough examinations of our Body Exfoliators

We do not use any formaldehyde, or formaldehyde releasers in any of our formulations

Parabens only appear in one Molton Brown product:
Stress-Relieving
Hydrosoak

We use ethanolamine compoundsin the following products:
•Cocamide MEA - Used in some of our shampoo and outlet formulations as co surfactant, to provide lather and mildness
•Trideceth-12 - Emulsifier, provides the glue (interface between oil and water)
• Laureth-4 - Co surfactant provides mildness, lather and fragrance rendition on skin
•Glycereth-2 Cocoate –A surfactant emulsifier, provides the “glue” (interface between oil and water)
•Tetrasodium EDTA - Chelant, metal ion scavenger – Grabs all the positive charged ions and locks them away. It also protects the formula from light fastness and provides stability.

Phenoxyethanol is an approved preservative when used in volumes of up to 1% of a formulation. It is a widely used preservative amongst Molton Brown formulations which protects products from bacteria manifestation

CONTROVERSIAL INGREDIENTS
PALM OIL
We do not source any palm oil or palm kernel oil directly. We source palm oil derivatives. One of the most important derivatives is SLES (Sodium Lauryl Ethyl Sulphate), used as the surfactant in our hand wash, body washes and hair care to create the foamy lather. We also source other palm oil derivatives.

NEVER TESTED ON ANIMALS
Molton Brown UK does not use animals to test any of our products. We closely examine all ingredients and products before they go on the market to ensure that they meet the safety expectations outlined in the PCPC Consumer Commitment Code, US FDA and EU regulations, and many other recognised regulatory agencies.

MICROBEADS, EXFOLIATES & GLITTER
At Molton Brown we produce products containing biodegradable particles.
• Our cleansing and exfoliating products contain solid particles that are made from naturally derived ingredients including sugar, ground olive stones, ground apricot seeds, and Tahitian sand.
• The glitter found in our products are made from natural minerals such as tin oxide, and/or natural metals including gold, silver and copper.
• We are pleased to advise Molton Brown products do not contain non-biodegradable Microbeads.
• In addition, none of our products emit plastic into the environment.

OUR PRODUCTS
GREEN CHEMISTRY
Green Chemistry is the term that references the use of natural resources to produce a product in an environmentally friendly way, also known as sustainable chemistry It is an area of chemistry and chemical engineering focused on the designing of products and processes that minimise or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances We are not investigating Green Chemistry at this time While environmental chemistry focuses on the effects of polluting chemicals on nature, green chemistry focuses on the environmental impact of chemistry, including technological approaches to preventing pollution and reducing consumption of non-renewable resources

SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING
Most local councils do not recycle mixed materials so we are proactively looking to pilot a “Return, Reward, Recycle” scheme across stores

100% of our accessory outer packs can be recycled* *cartons and wrappers

From Q1 2020 we will manufacture bottles 50% recycled plastic

GIFT WRAP
We re-launched our corporate packaging for our Bespoke Gifting service in August 2019. Our new proposition uses 15 tons less material than our previous packaging. Pioneer Sustainable Lifestyles

PRODUCT
GIFT BOXES
• The dyes used on our boxes and bags are environmentally friendly and do not affect recyclability.
• Our gift boxes are recyclable but you need to remove the magnet from the front of the box first.
• All of our bags are recyclable except for the handles, which can be removed prior to disposal.

EMBELLISHMENTS
• We have removed the additional “tie-close” ribbon and replaced this with a recyclable sticker.
• During the design phase, we chose to size our Brand logo and Royal Warrant within the recommended dimensions, so as not effect recyclability TISSUE PAPER
• Our tissue paper is recyclable, biodegradable and compostable. You can dispose of the tissue in your food or green waste
• We use FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) approved paper. We are looking at refillable formats across the rest of our collections, so watch this space.

EXTERIOR PACKAGING
GIFT WRAP
Adding “whole order gift wrap” to an online order is optional and at the discretion of our customers. Papershred void fill is used inside gift boxes to make sure products arrive with customers just as beautifully as when they leave us. These materials are all recyclable through the majority of local councils (borough/council dependent).

CORRUGATES
We provide cardboard corrugates to carry our online orders with paper labelling and for transporting our products globally to our distributors, wholesalers, business partners and stores. 

PAPILLION PAPER
We use Papillion Paper for general corrugate void fill (outside of gift boxes or where gift boxes are not selected) for securely packing our online orders and to prevent damage during transit. This material is widely recyclable.

HOTEL
We distribute our hotel amenity collections across the globe and to some very remote destinations – a mindful consideration for us when developing our hotel amenities collections.

GREEN DOT
PROGRAMME
We participate in the EU’s Green Dot Programme. This symbol lets your guests know that our packaging is part of the collect/sorting process with participating EU states. The Mobius loop is included on our packaging to indicate how to recycle empty containers. Loop is a global platform that enables consumer product companies and retailers to shift from a disposable supply chain to a durable one.

DISPENSING
PROGRAMME
We offer an environmentally friendly Dispensing Program solution, which includes a lockable wall dispenser that allows our Hoteliers to use 5 Litre containers to refill our washes and lotions in communal areas and spaces.
         
REDUCING PACKAGING 
We are looking at alternative options to reduce the single use plastics that our current propositions offer to improve our impact on sustainability; including: Reducing packaging material by removing unnecessary cartons, reduce wall thickness of necessary packaging

RECYCLABILITY
We are committed to improving biodegradability/recyclability by removing laminate layers. We are moving from single use packaging to refill/multi use with dispenser systems.

CANDLES
We are aware that in recent times some ingredients in candles have received some negative coverage and can be seen as polluters.  Our candles are a blend of wax and high volumes of fragrance to deliver the sensorial fragrance experience that both we and our customers expect

We are exploring alternative natural waxes. It is unlikely that we will be able to manufacture a candle with 100% natural wax – more feasibility a 50/50 blend with our current paraffin wax material

We are continuing to look for ways to develop the sustainability of our candles moving forwards

Changing to a blend of natural wax material will form part of making our candles more environmentally friendly

We currently use paraffin wax for our candles 

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are a group of carbon-based chemicals which evaporate easily at room temperature to form vapours or gases. As VOCs evaporate into the air, they have been shown to have a possible negative impact on the indoor/outdoor air quality, and on the environment. Molton Brown takes its impact on the environment very seriously. Currently our products adhere to the maximum levels of VOCs permitted in the countries where we sell

REFILLS
Alongside the launch of our provocative new Fragrance Collections, we are delighted to offer refills for both our 100ml Eaux de Parfum and Eaux de Toilettes. Customers can enjoy their signature scent time and time again, with sustainability in mind. Please note that whilst we are able to refill our 100ml fragrances this service experience is currently piloting across 4 UK stand alone stores. If the pilot is successful we are hoping to roll this out to other locations, globally in 2020/21. Pioneer Sustainable Lifestyles

PRODUCT
As you can imagine, adopting refillable services across our global estate and product offerings demands extensive attention to:
• Physical space in store (shop floor and back of store) for a refill display/ unit
• Which stores to offer this service in, considering both our own stand-alone stores and concessions
•Which products we offer the refill service for – it may not be viable to offer refills across all of our product collections
•Preventing cross-contamination of products
•The Customers in-store experience

WHATS NEXT FOR SUSTAINABILITY
We are working on innovations to improve sustainability across our product collections.
REUSING
BOTTLES
Reuse of previous / returned bottles: Although, we recognise there is the challenge of customer fatigue with this process and the aesthetic appearance.

REFILLING
BOTTLES
After approximately 3-4 uses the bottle would become less durable and need replacing entirely. A challenge we face is that it would be difficult to manage how many times a bottle had been re-used. In addition there needs to be cleaning process after each use.

OPTIMAL
USAGE
In addition, the cleaning of the used bottles would need to be considered as part of the refill manufacturing process. Recyclability back to original material/usage would provide the optimal usage, but would be potentially costly to both our business and the consumer. 

DOWNCYCLING
Down-cycling: Our Japanese parent company, Kao Corporation, are able to recycle their plastic waste into plastic bricks for children. In the UK we do not have such options at this time and this would be a longer term goal.

OUR OFFICES AND MANUFATURING FACILITY SAVING ENERGY

SAVING ENERGY
We use light motion detection sensors in all of our office spaces and meeting rooms, which automatically switch off lights after 15 minutes of non-activity. The majority of our lightbulbs are now energy saving LED, although there are some areas within our manufacturing plant which we are in the process of converting.
• We optimise our manufacturing schedules to provide greater continuity in the production runs; to reduce the need to start/ stop the manufacturing or filling lines. This helps to save energy and water used in the sanitisation process required between each new run. 

PRINTING
• We have designated printers on each of our office floors that centralises all printing needs. Employees are reminded only to print documents that are absolutely essential to have in a hard copy. All printers have a default setting of printing on both sides to reduce paper waste.

• We purchase electricity for our Manufacturing Facility, Green Street offices and our Stores from renewable sources only (wind, solar and tidal). This means that with the exception of our heating (currently diesel and gasoline) all our energy is green. At this time the electricity supplied to our Shaftesbury Avenue office is sourced via the Service Charge for the building. Therefore we cannot confirm if this is from a Green Energy source at this time.
• We have Zip Hydrotapsin our kitchen facilities, providing our employees with instant boiling and chilled water. This replaces the need to re-boiling kettles and reduces plastic waste from the previous water cooler unit refills.

OUR OFFICES
RECYCLING & WASTE
KITCHEN

Our employees are provided with crockery and cutlery, as well as dishwashers in the kitchen areas to prevent the use of single use plastics. Many of our employees opt to bring in their own lunch using reusable pots from home

WASTE
We are expected to actively separate waste in clearly labelled rubbish bins, including paper, food, plastics and cardboard, collected and recycled by a third party waste management company. Obsolete electronic waste including computer equipment, TVs, printers etc. are all recycled, although we are investigating donation programs as an alternative.

PRINTING
We use recycled paper for our offices, however we are looking at alternative options for our current premium grade paper used for compliments slips and letterheads - currently not from recycled sources. Used printer toners and ink cartridges are recycled post use.

CLEANING
We use non harmful and specialised cleaning products to sanitise equipment between each production run and at the end of the shift, which reduces the amount of water required.

OUR MANUFATURING FACILITY
RECYCLING & WASTE

We set annual targets to reduce manufacturing waste through efficiencies in planning and processes, with the overall objective of reaching zero. We have an inhouse team who are working on a proposal to have the separation process on site although at moment we are limited on the space that we have and where we would store the recycled wate

It is impossible to eradicate waste bulk product an  although this is a very low volume for us we do recycle our liquid waste using a third party. They separate the water from any solids (from our lotions for example), generating electricity in the process

Cardboard waste from the Manufacturing Facility such as corrugates/ packaging is compressed in-house prior to sending it to a 3rd party recycling plant

We use non harmful and specialised cleaning products to sanitise equipment between each production run and at the end of the shift, which reduces the

REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT

We have targets every year to continuously reduce our green house gas generation. There have been vast improvements related to optimisation of manufacturing schedules and improved cleaning processes which are helping us on that journey Although all of our energy is from carbon free sources, we have to use fuel to generate heat for the production of some of our products and heating of our offices. We are working on proposals to eliminate this requirement. 

Our transportation is handled by third party courier companies who are working on their own initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. It is difficult to overcome the need to fuel the vehicles. That said, we look at combining journeys all the time, to make every journey count We opt for sea freight to supply our global business, in preference to air freight wherever possible Our manufacturing plant is located in a rural area on a small industrial estate which does not have catering facilities on site. To prevent employees having to travel individually to get food, we have a family run local bakery which visits all the businesses on the Green Street (Elsenham) site

We now manufacture Street (Elsenham) site two of our shampoos using cold mix processes, replacing hot mix which eliminates the need to heat the mixing vessels. We are looking at moving to this way of manufacturing across other product formats

ONLINE COMMUNICATION
We provide conference calls with screen share facilities across all employee PCs/ Laptops to prevent unnecessary physical travel – this also allows us to keep in touch with our global colleagues on a regular basis.

These windows lights are on a timer to automatically switch off at the same time as local street lights We re-use fixtures and fittings where possible in new store fits and pop up locations. Shop fit waste that can be recycled (and are not fit for repurposing) are sent to recycling centres All power (apart from the tilling systems, so as not to affect business reporting and continuity) is switched off at store closing time. In areas not consistently in use, lights are switched off straight after use e.g. stockroom, staff room, offices

Managers Guide

Why do we have a

Christmas Discovery Guide?
Everyone deserves the best start at Molton Brown and our Christmas Sales Consultants are no exception. They begin their journey with Molton Brown at our busiest time of year and they often feel overwhelmed as they have a lot to learn in a short space of time. The Christmas Discovery Guide which is found on the Digital Learning Academy is a tool designed to provide our Christmas Sales Consultants with all the information they need to understand their role, our products and our service expectations. 

Shaping the Future 2020 is going to be a big year for the Digital Learning Academy with new and exciting modules being created to support your learning at Molton Brown. Putting The Christmas Discovery Guide into practice will help you become familiar with the learning involved in the ”New” Discovery Guide, which is being launched on the DLA in 2020. Your feedback is important to us so please get in touch with the Customer Experience Team to let us know how you used The Christmas Discovery Guide in your store. Was it useful? Is there anything that needs to be included? Is there anything you would change?

Your Role
Our Christmas Sales Consultants also need YOUR support and guidance to make their experience at Molton Brown a memorable one. The more time you invest in your Christmas Sales Consultants by going through the Christmas Discovery Guide , the more beneficial they will become to
your store! Developing their knowledge will build customer rapport and will support every sale opportunity that arises, which will help to deliver the store’s KPI’s.

What Part Do You Play?
Take your mind back to your first day at Molton Brown, how did you feel? You were probably supported every step of the way in your new role. Your support is essential when using The Christmas Discovery Guide with your Christmas Sales Consultants. Some content within the guide is activity based and they will be unable to complete their learning without your help and guidance.

How long will it take?
As soon as your Christmas Sales Consultant begins their Molton Brown festive journey they have THREE WEEKS to complete the Christmas Discovery Guide. They are also required to complete the Christmas Campaign Course which will give them all the knowledge they need to provide the best customer experience this Christmas. Every Christmas Sales Consultant will require 1 hour 32minutes per week to complete both courses. Remember…the more time you invest in training your Christmas Sales Consultants the greater your achievements will be!

So what do you need to do?
Preparation is key so take a look at the points below:-
• Complete the Christmas Discovery Guide. This will get you up to speed with what is required when using the guide with your new starter
• Once you are familiar with what is involved you can plan to spend time with your Christmas Sales Consultant. Remember there are modules that require your support especially around Till Training and Product Knowledge!
• Use your team to support the new starter. There may be some modules that your team can be involved with. This can also help your new starter to get to know people in the team
• Once your Christmas Sales Consultant has completed a module it is important that you ask questions on what they have learned. Ask them what they have discovered or test them on their knowledge.
• Remember to always check their progress! This is important as the guide will build confidence and benefit your sales. 

The Christmas Discovery Guide is key to developing successful Christmas Sales Consultants, remember, they could be the stars of the future. Please ensure the guide is completed fully on the Digital Learning Academy with EVERY Christmas Sales Consultant.

• Here you want to establish who the customer is buying for. This will allow you to assess whether you’ll need to offer our bespoke gift wrap service.
• If the customer is buying a gift, you can consider offering them the opportunity to also try for themselves. Think…WHO, WHO & YOU What is the most important thing to you when buying a fragrance?
• This will guide you to the information you can provide the customer. e.g The Customer is a heritage buff, therefore you can share the Molton Brown story
• You will gain an understanding regarding the customers fragrance knowledge.
• This could also give you an insight into the brands or ingredients the customer prefers. Describe to me their/his/her/your/others personality in three words?
• This will potentially guide you into the fragrance families the customer prefers. e.g. If they use words such as romantic, sensual, graceful, caring or loving, what fragrance family would you suggest?
• This could also guide you in their approach to why they wear a fragrance. e.g If they use words such as traditional, classic or indulgent they are considered to love the finer things in life. Which fragrance would you recommend? What is you favourite Aroma?
• This will also potentially guide you into the fragrance families the customer prefers. e.g. Should the customer mention they love the aroma of fresh coffee it could indicate that a “Woody” fragrance would appeal to them.
• Should the customer love the smell of baked bread it could indicate that a “Gourmand” fragrance would appeal to them. What do you already know about our Molton Brown Fragrances?

Gift with Purchase
The perfect way to enhance your customers experience is to introduce the GWP, but when is the right time to do this……..?
• Once you have agreed on a single unit sale, e.g. Orange & Bergamot Eau de Pafrum, offer your customer the opportunity to experience the rest of the collection.
• If the customer is happy with just their single purchase, surprise them with the choice of their gift with purchase.
• Add value to the GWP by complimenting their choice, guiding and
supporting their decisions with your fabulous product knowledge.
• Invite the customer back to let you know how they got on with the products in their gift. Statistics tell us that once a customer reaches a point of payment they generally have made up their mind on what they intend to spend and are often thinking of where they are going next. So, what do we do at the till point…? Closing the sale
• Provide your customers with a seamless, professional and efficient till point
experience.
• Any messages, offers and unique personalisation opportunities should have been discussed earlier. Think about your journey with the customer so far, where were the opportunities to offer: Bespoke Gift Wrap? Data Capture? GWP? Personalisation?"
FAQ's,"ELIMINATING THE OUCHES
FAQ’S
Why are you no longer providing the duo boxes in store and only online as a carton? Having reviewed our Gifting Proposition we still want to provide customers with an elevated Gifting offer. However, we do not want to over package our products, which is why we have removed the duo box from our Gifting Offer.

Is it necessary to have so much tissue paper? We have worked to use the minimum amount of tissue paper, only a couple of sheets per box or bag. Our tissue paper is recyclable, biodegradable and compostable. You can dispose of the tissue in your food or green waste.

What dyes are used on the boxes and bag – are these environmentally friendly? The dyes used on our boxes and bag are environmentally friendly.

Are you not worried about sustainability? Light years ahead of our time, sustainability has been always been at the heart of Molton Brown. Our founders always used packaging which could be recycled easily and were among the first to be against animal testing. Today, we strongly believe Luxury and Sustainability go hand in hand, which is why this new Gifting Offer uses 15 tons less material than our previous packaging. In addition, our teams are working very hard to make this packaging even more sustainable for the future. 

Do you need to use plastic bags to wrap you candles/ aroma reeds/ Christmas gift boxes? Is the wrapper recyclable? To ensure your products arrive to you in pristine condition, we aim to package products carefully and securely to prevent marking or scuffing on your products. The plastic wrapping is not recyclable. The use of the plastic wrapping is currently under review

Are the new boxes and bags recyclable? Our boxes are recyclable but you need to remove the magnet from the front of the box first. All of our bags are recyclable except the handles, which can be removed. We would advise you to re-use our boxes and bags as a beautiful storage solution rather than recycling.

Are the ribbons recyclable? Unfortunately, at this stage our ribbons are not recyclable. We would advise you to re-use our beautiful ribbons as an adornment to any gift. We are looking at an alternative for the future. 

Why has the print on the boxes/tissue paper changed? As we aim to refine our Brand Experience to its very best, we have reworked our Gifting Boxes
to align them with the look and feel of our new Fragrance Packaging. This still incorporates our signature Molton Brown Compass pattern.

Why have you changed the duo box? You are a luxury brand; I expect the old style. Having reviewed our Gifting Proposition we still want to provide customers with elevated Gifting offer. However, we do not want to over package our products, which is why we have removed the duo box from our Gifting Offer

What elements of Molton Brown’s gift wrap
materials are recyclable?
- Boxes (please remove the magnet before recycling)
- Bags (please remove handles before recycling)
- Tissue Paper
- Tissue paper stickers
- The adhesive tape on gift boxes

Why have you changed for a box and lid to a magnet lock box?
In line with current trends we have updated the design of our gift boxes to a magnet close.

I want to add something else into my bag, but the sticker is already closed? No problem! Please just ask for a replacement bag and sticker. 

Why have you changed the handles of the bag from ribbons to acrylic handles? In line with current trends we have updated the design of our gift bags to acrylic handles"

Senior Perfumer Maïa Lernout’s vision was sparked by a sojourn to the idyllic Punaauia beach, Tahiti. She pays tribute to the native tiare flower; Tahitian women have, for centuries, macerated the blossom in coconut oil and used it as love philtre on their hair.

Meet the Perfumer

Philippe Paparella loves to work with Woody, Ambery and Musky notes for their sensual aspects and how the evoke emotion and feeling.  But what was his inspiration for the irresistible and iridescent Rose Dunes collection?
 
Campaign Brand Pillars

We use only the best ingredients in exceptional concentrations, which is also the case for the new Rose Dunes collection. For this fragrance, we have picked a blend of rose, saffron and sustainably-sourced patchouli to bring this fresh, yet warming and opulent element to the fragrance.

Re-supporting our existing ESG achievements and commitments, we have worked closely with the suppliers of some of our natural materials to ensure their sustainability.


The key signature note of the Eau de Parfum, Patchouli Sulawesi, has been sustainably sourced. You will learn more about this ingredient later.


In an effort to reduce virgin materials, the Eau de Parfum sleeve contains 50% recycled materials.

Passionate about Ambery fragrances and previously based in the Middle East, the perfumer, Philippe Paparella, has adopted a global interpretation on Middle Eastern ingredients and fragrances. Philippe has created a multifaceted fragrance that both resonates with Middle Eastern customers and has a large scale global appeal.

Rose Dunes will truly be a blockbuster launch.

A native from the South of France, his career started at the Mane Perfumer Training Program, before being posted in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2001. In 2003, Philippe moved to China, where he joined Symrise, a major producer of fragrances in May 2008. Since 2016, Philippe has been in Dubai. Philippe especially loves working with woody, ambery and musky notes for their sensual aspects. In Southeast Asia, he learned to work with exotic fruits such as mango and pineapple. He is always thrilled by the transformation of a written formula into an actual fragrance, bringing to life a strong feeling or emotion.
Optimism is one of Philippe’s qualities. He is passionate about life and has a keen interest in fashion and fitness. He does not shy away from trying new things and is heavily inspired by his own imagination...
""A picture or a word could lead me to imagine the flower I want to create. My imagination plays a very important role in my work, even more so than experiences.""
Facts About Philippe Paparella

Apprentices are trained at the MANE School of Perfumery for a minimum of two years, during which they follow a thorough, customised programme.

This programme endows the trainees with a profound knowledge of natural products, chemistry of perfumery and cosmetic ingredients along with the science of olfaction, all the while nourishing their unique and creative talent.

Junior Perfumers complete their training “on the job”, under the mentorship of a Senior Perfumer.

Not only does Philippe enjoy travelling the world, he has also spent many years living in different locations from the South of France, Indonesia and Dubai.

These cultural experiences have helped to inspire his approach to perfumery, whilst his ideas for scents come from his own imagination of a destination, or desired object.

Philippe especially loves working with woody, ambery and musky notes for their sensual aspects.

Woody notes: Earthy, Grounding and Clean

Ambery: Sensual, Exoticism

Musky: Gentle, Warm and Comforting

The concept for Rose Dunes stemmed from a Desert Rose - which is an intricate rose-like formation of crystal clusters and are the only type of rose to be found in the desert.
This rare, mystifying creation was Philippe Paparella's inspiration for Rose Dunes.
Let us take a closer look at these elusive crystal formations...

The crystal formations only occur in arid sandy conditions, and are formed from the combination of water, wind and sand merging in salt water basins.
The water evaporates over thousands of years, leaving these beautiful crystal formations in the basins.
These crystals are also the inspiration for the packaging design that you can see on the limited edition sleeve!

A traditional Native American tale stated that Desert Rose Selenites were carved by warriors who returned home from the spirit world. The roses were said to have been spread across the Earth to protect these spirits’ homeland.
It is also considered an affirmation stone. Holding one, or keeping one close by is believed to bring feelings of self confidence and worth.

Desert Roses form in many desert areas such as Saudi Arabia, Australia, Morocco, Mexico, and South Africa.

Desert Rose is also sometimes called Gypsum Rose, Selenite Rose, Rose Rock, Gypsum Rosette, Selenite and Sand Rose.

Ensuring we deliver a great First Impression when a customer is in our store is an integral part of delivering the Molton Brown Flow Philosophy.
The release of a new fragrance collection brings lots of exciting opportunities to engage with loyal Molton Brown customers - and new ones too!
Having exceptional product knowledge about our latest release is vital to delivering a fantastic First Impression...

The Heavenly Words we use to describe Rose Dunes help to paint a picture for a customer when talking about this new collection.
Below you will see the brand story for Rose Dunes and the 3 Heavenly Words used to describe it.

A blooming mirage glistens among dusty-pink sand dunes at sunset. Shimmering hazes of golden saffron, tinged with rich cassis. The floral swirl of velvety rose and geranium, swept up in earthy patchouli Sulawesi – silent and sumptuous. Fall under its spell; get lost in the mystic beauty of the desert.

Iridescent. Mystifying. Hypnotic.

Let's identify which primary and secondary fragrance families that Rose Dunes belongs to.
This will help you to understand its olfactive profile and also give you ideas as to what other fragrances to suggest to your customer.

Primary: Ambery -  Defined as warm, opulent and mysterious, ambery fragrances are originally built around raw materials such as ambergris and musk, combined with woody, tobacco, spicy and marine facets. With access to synthetic ingredients, contemporary ambery perfumes are softer, usually featuring vanilla, labdanum, cinnamon, pepper or oudh accord.

Secondary: Floral / Rose

One of the most popular and ancient families in perfume history. As its name implies, flowers take centre stage to create a fragrant bouquet with blossoms such as rose, jasmine, violet, iris, lily, lily of the valley, narcissus or tuberose.
Rose Dunes is classed as more of a Rose fragrance due to the prominence of both romantic rose and rose-like geranium.

The Eau de Toilette is a celebration of rose with rich cassis that glistens at the top, softened by intimate saffron and velvety rose.

The earthy-mossy base is deepened by patchouli and pulses of resinous amber.

The Eau de Parfum is an addictive fragrance that is hypnotic.
Fresh Madagascan pepper and ginger is wrapped by a dark bloom of rose. An addictive oudh accord awaits in the lingering base of sandalwood, musk and vetiver.

Merry Berries & Mimosa Introduction,"For the release of this years festive limited edition, Merry Berries & Mimosa, we will be focusing our three important brand pillars that are featured within this campaign.

These Brand Pillars play an important part in understanding the collection & what our brand values are.

Click FLIP on each image below to learn more about each of these pillars...

Quality

The new Christmas fragrance is an elegant take on the Fruity-Floral fragrance family, with a Molton Brown twist.



The ingredients used have a focus on sustainability as well as quality.



Sophisticated mimosa – a delicate, winter blooming flower with a global harvest of only 100-300kg per year is used in this collection. We have ensured that it is sustainably grown, harvested and produced.



We have partnered with Sedex, who are a membership organisation that provides one of the world's leading online platforms for companies to manage and improve working conditions in global supply chains.


We Treasure
Our World

To help reduce waste, we use plastic bottles with at least 50% recycled plastic at our carbon neutral manufacturing facility in Elsenham.



Our reusable gift boxes and crackers are made from 100% recycled materials and can be recycled once the base label is removed.

The Advent Calendar contains a metal plaque, which would need to be removed before recycling.


Our bespoke Christmas ribbon is made from 70% recycled materials for a conscious
finishing flourish for your customers gifts.




We Celebrate Individuality

This Christmas we celebrate imperfections and mischievousness!



Our broad selection of limited edition collections and gifts ensure that every individual can find their perfect fragrance match - whether that is a full-size Eau de Parfum, to a Mini Hand Cream.


For the launch of Merry Berries & Mimosa we will be focusing on three important pillars to bring this campaign to life.

These pillars play an important part in understanding this years Christmas collection and how & why it came to be.

Click FLIP on each image below to learn more about each of these pillars...

Wellbeing
Flip
Nostalgia plays a big part in this years Christmas campaign as people are turning to feelings of comfort to enhance a sense of well being after a turbulent period of unease. This will hopefully be the first Christmas in several years uninterrupted by the pandemic.



With this in mind, Molton Brown have considered nostalgic formulas and fragrances that bring back happy memories and support a feeling of comfort and wellbeing.


Togetherness

During the pandemic we saw an elevated trend towards Conscious Consumerism which continues to this day.



Customers are deliberately making purchasing decisions that they believe have a positive social, economic, and environmental impact. In short, it means shopping with sustainability in mind.



This was a big focus for our 2021 Christmas Campaign, and you will learn more about some of the ESG credentials and how they are clearly communicated to customers this year.




Finding Joy

Last but not least, Molton Brown have also considered that the Merry Berries & Mimosa campaign should offer a celebratory and mischievous feel to put a smile onto customers faces!



At a time when the world feels a little precarious, we find comfort and hope in feelings of nostalgia and surrounding ourselves with our nearest and dearest to create new, happy memories together.

Store Standards & Housekeeping,"Store Standards & Housekeeping
For over 50 years, Molton Brown has established itself as a luxury brand. Selling products of the highest quality, our customers have come to expect the ultimate shopping experience whenever they visit our stores.



With this in mind our store standards must always remain high. Establishing a store environment that exceeds our customers expectations encourages them to return over and over again.



Let's discover more about these standards...

Attractive displays can draw the customer's attention and entice them to purchase.
With this in mind, we need to ensure our standards of display are always maintained, keeping our categories & collections appealing to everyone who enters our store.

Whether you work in a Stand Alone Store, Outlet Store or a Wholesale Concession, your store must always be clean and the stock fully replenished at all times.

The images below provide you with an example of how the bays in store should appear to our customers:

Standard Collection Bays
1971 Collection Library

Let's discover the ways in which you can maintain these standards of display in your store.

Click on each image below to learn more:

General Cleanliness
A clean store creates a positive first impression and has a direct impact on sales and the customer's experience.

We all have a part to play in maintaining the cleanliness of the store. Let's look at the tasks that need to be completed on a regular basis to ensure the store is clean at all times:

Products must be clean & free from dust.
Testers must be clean & free from dust.
Testers must be suitably full for use.
Bays & Shelves must be cleaned and dust free at all times
The Sink/Hub must cleaned after every use.
Paper Towels must be replenished.
The store must be hoovered & mopped daily.

Display Guidelines
To maintain display standards in store there are a few key ways to keep your displays interesting & inviting :

All products must face to the front with pumps facing to the left.
There should be one tester per product on the bays.
Position the tester to the right of each product group.
Silver 'Try Me' stickers should be used on all tester products.
Damaged testers will need to be replaced, so notify your manager as soon as you discover one.
A full list of VM standards is included with every new campaign launch. Your Store Manager will share this with you ahead of any launch.

Stock Replenishment
With store targets to achieve, we need to make sure that our customers have all of our categories & collections available to them.

This help us to maximise sales as it provides us with the opportunity to cross sell and increase our KPI's.

Listed below are the tasks we need to complete around stock replenishment:

Stock Replenishment should be completed throughout the day.
Always fill from the back of the display to maintain good stock management.
Ensure all drawers & cupboards are full with stock from the stockroom.
Replenish bays with stock from drawers & cupboards.
Replenish till point items such as bags & tissue paper.

As a part of the team, we must always maintain shop floor standards to create a luxury shopping environment for our customers.

To keep the shop floor running at full capacity we also have to consider the standards within the stores stockroom.

Keeping an organised stockroom can have a huge impact on the day to day running of the store. Here are some of the reasons as to why we must ensure the stockroom is running effectively:

Categories & collections are easier to find, making the task of replenishing stock easier to complete so that our products fully available to our customers.
Stocktaking can also be completed quickly and accurately as products are easy to locate and count.
A well maintained stockroom also minimises potential health & safety risks as hazards can be identified quickly, creating a safe environment for the team.
Let's look at some of the standards that need to be implemented when working in the stockroom.

Click flip on each card below to discover more:

General Cleanliness
- If storing stock in the stockroom after a delivery always make sure that shelves are not overloaded with boxes of stock.



- Shelving must be safe and secure at all times. If you identify a potential risk please notify a member of the management team..



- The stockroom should be free from clutter. Stock should always be stored on shelving or in a safe area to avoid any trip hazards.



- Stockrooms must be free from rubbish at all times. Boxes from a delivery must be broken down and then disposed of once the delivery has been completed.



- If ladders are used in the stockroom make sure they are put away safely after use to avoid any health & safety risks.

Stock Management
 The layout of the stockroom should be sectioned into product categories e.g. Bath & Body products together. If you are putting stock in to the stockroom always make sure it is placed in the correct area.



- All boxes should be sealed with no loose stock. Loose stock can be placed in drawers and cupboards on the shop floor, making stock replenishment manageable.



- If you are placing stock in the stockroom after completing a delivery, always put the boxes of stock you have had delivered towards the back of the relevant product category. This will ensure that the older batch codes are sold as a priority.



- If you replenishing the drawers on the shop floor from the stockroom, always ensure you take or open boxes of stock from the front of the stockroom shelves.



- Do not dump stock in random areas of the stockroom. Doing this will make items harder to locate and stock could be missed when counting at a stocktake.



- Always notify a member of management if you notice a damaged product in the stockroom.

Fragrance Consultations
As part of our mission to be recognised as a fragrance first retailer, we have reviewed our current fragrance consultation proposition and re-worked it to include a blend of education and entertainment to enhance the customers experience. We have also provided YOU with some exciting tools to achieve this.

Rose Dunes Collection,Meet The Perfumer
The NEW Home Fragrance Collection,"With the increasing popularity to showcase objects of desire on social media, combined with spending more time at home, consumers are drawn to items that are aesthetically pleasing as well as practical for their purpose.

The need for packaging goes beyond its initial purpose, with customers wanting to repurpose the vessels and display them on shelves or coffee tables.



Read the three key pillars below that helped guide us with the design of our Home Collection restage.

More Than A Candle

Luxury home fragrances are required to go beyond their first function with elevated packaging and reinvented formats to keep customers engaged.

With this in mind, we decided to revamp our Home Collection with a timeless, sleek and minimal design that anyone would be proud to showcase in their home.

Repurpose

As more of us stayed at home due to lockdown demands, we were suddenly faced with the reality of how much waste we generate.

Our new home collection's outer packaging has been massively reduced and the new design encourages customers to repurpose their vessels and do their part in reducing their environmental impact!

From Office to Bedroom

For the majority, switching off from working at home can be difficult.

Finding ways to create a separation between work and home are limited. It is incredibly important to create a feeling of sanctuary and relaxation - and home scenting plays a huge part in being able to do this and transport us to other places and times!

Our 3 key objectives
Strengthen our Home Category through a new elevated design and home accessories with improved product & fragrance performance.

Increase our category productivity by focusing our offer on best selling fragrances and covering key olfactive families for the Home Fragrance Category.

Continue building our ESG (Environmental Social Governance) credentials through sustainable packaging and refillable solutions.

Meet the Perfumer
A Master Perfumer in every sense, Jacques Chabert has an exhaustive and encyclopaedic knowledge of fragrance. Having created some of the industry’s most iconic scents including Guerlain’s Samsara and Chanel’s Cristalle, he is truly at the absolute epicentre of his craft.

 

His love of fragrance began at an early age when he spent his childhood summers in Grasse, picking jasmine flowers and learning about notes.


Not afraid of taking risks, and keen to transcend fragrant stereotypes, he is truly an original perfumery trailblazer. His approach is instinctive and wildly creative. Jacques is passionate about the reconstruction of naturals. For him, tuberose, oakmoss and jasmine count as three of his most beguiling ingredients.

 

Jacques has been working with Molton Brown since 1993 and was the nose behind some of our most iconic original fragrances including Re-charge Black Pepper, Heavenly Gingerlily, Lime & Patchouli and Amber Cocoon.

Jacques Individuality
What was the inspiration behind Re-charge Black Pepper?

Inspired by the bold spirit of adventure, vivacious citrus notes entwine with a spice-spiked breeze of warm, resinous black pepper and the confidence of lingering, earthy tones. Light violet leaf and coriander breathe brightness into dark, sensual vetiver for an iconic fragrance.” - Jacques Chabert, Master Perfumer

Naranja orbs light winding calles like fragrant lanterns. A joyful throng of revellers celebrate under the arcs of the vibrant bitter orange trees. Sparkling petitgrain lingers verdant in the percussive Flamenco- punctuated air. Enliven your soul with energising luminous intensity. 

Meet the Perfumer

Beverly’s olfactory credentials are world-class. Her stellar career has spanned over forty years and she is one of the most renowned female noses in the industry.

 

Hugely fascinated by nature, she draws much of her creative inspiration from the colour, light and aromas of the landscape around her. Food is also a strong passion point for Beverly; linking a Perfumer’s knowledge of fragrant notes to a Chef’s ability to balance flavours.

 

She sees perfumery as an emotional process, imbuing all her creations with an element of individuality and humanity. Ultimately she believes the key to powerful perfumery is personal connection. And each of her fragrances reflect a little part of herself.

What was the inspiration behind Orange & Bergamot?

“Orange and bergamot is a celebration of joy and energy. I wanted to capture blooming orange flowers and ylang-ylang and let their notes shine bright. Petitgrain and neroli fuse with the strong floral middle notes to enhance this delightful brightness.”

-  Beverley Bayne, Master Perfumer

London Via The High Seas -

Step aboard on a quest to discover the world’s hidden treasures.

 

Luxurious. Seafaring. Immersive.

Perfumer - Philippe Bousseton

Philippe Bousseton first came into contact with the world of fragrance when he was only five. His maternal grandfather was a perfumer. Attracted to working in perfume, he began to study chemistry. In 1971, he was one of the five students at ISIPCA, a perfumery school that had just opened. The school year was only just over when he joined Dana.

 

When the company closed in 1979, he went to work for Oril Fontarome.  It was in 1982 that the doors really opened for him when he joined Takasago, a new name in the European world of fragrances, with Michel Almairac and Pierre Bourdon at the helm on the creative side of the business.

 

It was a fabulous period for Philippe Bousseton, who spent his time juggling between toiletries and perfumes. He got so used to it that it actually became his philosophy of life, one in which he finds pride, humility and joy.

What was the inspiration behind Immersive Samphire & Eucalyptus?

Our first fragrance brings together two Seabourn ports which are over 5000 miles apart.

 

The first stop – the French Atlantic coast. This beautiful coastline is home to a long seafaring tradition and gives us our first ingredient, Samphire.

 

Our second stop – China.

The coastal areas of Beijing gives us our second ingredient, Eucalyptus.

Eliminating the Ouches helps us provide a seamless service to our customers whilst in store.

 

Customers will be looking for a fast and efficient service, and so we need to be equipped with the skills and knowledge to deliver this.

BODY LANGUAGE, TONE AND WORDS
 
As we know from FLOW, communication comes across in a number of ways. Body Language, Tone and Words are all important when communicating.

 

There is a concept concerning the communication of emotions and how others percieve what we are saying.

 

The concept states that 55% of perception is through our Body Language, 38% through our Tone of Voice and only 7% of the Words we actually use!

 

Lets explore how we can adapt our approach to communicating through these methods.

London Via Florence - Suede Orris Eau de Parfum

Evening seeps into a candle-lit dressing room, bedecked with rich tapestries, Renaissance paintings and gilded mirrors. Couture suede gloves, scented with Tuscan orris, bestow an enigmatic touch for twilight revelries and careful seduction. Curvaceous blush flacons enrobe a clandestine profumo; fusing skin-caressing notes of suede, vanilla and cistus labdanum absolute. Swathe your senses in the essence of sumptuous sophistication.

Perfumer

“I was inspired by the precious gesture of orris scented gloves, which knew glory days of popularity with Catherine de Medici. I pictured her at night attending a sumptuous ball, where she did not hesitate to use the charms of her ladies to attract members of the court. This is a darker interpretation of the Eau de Toilette with black pepper, olibanum, suede and cistus labdanum, expressing a daring sensuality.”
– Jérôme Di Marino, New Generation Perfumer

Jérôme Di Marino
Discover Jérôme's Individuality

What was the inspiration behind Suede Orris Eau de Parfum?
Jérôme drew inspiration from Catherine de Medici; a famous Florentine noblewoman who became known as the ultimate trendsetter. Her Perfumer, Rene de Florentin had his own clandestine laboratory she would visit via a secret passage. It was here he created her iconic scented leather gloves, and from here that we sourced our pure, precious orris absolute.

LAYERING

Layering products on to the skin is a great way to enhance the aroma of your customers most loved fragrance.

 

From Fragrance to Body Oils, a variety of products can be layered together on the skin to intensify and give the fragrance longevity.

 

The most frequently used layering process is blending a fragranced body lotion alongside and Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum.

 

You can apply the fragrance first and follow with the lotion or the other way round... it doesn't matter which.

 

Both ways will add depth and intensity to the overall fragrance experience.

SHARING THE EXPERIENCE

Always spray two blotters, one for your customer and one for yourself, this way you can share the experience with the customer. 

 

Sharing the experience helps to build rapport between you and your customer.

 

This is also a great opportunity to remind yourself of the qualities of the fragrance.

SPRAYING BLOTTERS

When demonstrating a fragrance always use a blotter in the first instance. This is the purest way to initally try a fragrance. 

 

Hold the blotter approximately 6 inches away from the bottle and spray the fragrance lightly once on to each blotter.

 

Spraying a blotter more than once will make it too wet, therefore it will take longer for the fragrance to dry down.

 

TRYING A FRAGRANCE ON THE SKIN

If a customers wishes to try a fragrance on their skin, simply hand the bottle to the customer to try for themselves.

 

This avoids any unfortunate incidents of spraying the customers clothing or jewellery.

 

It also allows the customer to touch and feel the bottle, which gives them a sense of ownership.

 

Remember a fragrance may smell different on the customers skin to a blotter.

Definition of the Fragrance Finder Matrix,"The Fragrance Finder matrix is a complex structure that allows a combination of different elements - the 15 Molton Brown fragrances, most with an eau de toilette and an eau de parfum variant; an understanding of why the customer wears fragrance; and insights into what kind of behavioural traits each customer exhibits - to be used in all possible permutations to delivery the maximum number of selections and customer profiles.

This matrix creates a filtering and needs process that selects the Molton Brown fragrance ideally suited to the customer and reveals personal information about the customer's character, mindset and preferences.

The matrix is deployed with a choice architecture profiling process that analyses customers and determines into which of the 87 different attitudinal and behavioural profiles they fit. The matrix structure does two key things:

- Encapsulates and delineates the key offerings of perfume in terms of smell, style and appeal.
- Matches customers’ profiles to their ideal fragrance based on their characteristics, behaviours and needs."
Fragrance Finder,"The Fragrance Finder is all about matching the right fragrance to the customers, a choice architecture methodology in which the fragrance is not chosen by the customers but is selected for them following a series of filtering exercises and a rigorous process that eliminates options.

The process by which the final selection of fragrance is made for the customer is defined by the following three elements:

- Stage One: Preference: in which we identify why the customer wears fragrance 
- Stage Two: Character: in which we determine what the customer's behavioural traits are
- Stage Three: Mindset: in which we clarify how the customer prefers to receive information

These three differentials help us to define:
- The smell, style and type of product
- The segmentation of the customer
"
Stage One: Preference ,"This initial stage identifies the right product category for the customer. This is based on existing research into the drivers behind our motivations for wearing fragrance. The three options are: Attraction, Articulation & Function.

Preference: Attraction 

These customers' fragrance choices are motivated by seduction and provocation. They choose fragrances that are powerful, impactful and attractive to the opposite sex. For them, it is most important that a fragrance is strong and noticeable to others

Preference: Articulation 

These customers' fragrance choices are motivated by comfort and feeling cocooned. They choose fragrances that are moreish and addictive, so much so that they just want to smell the scent all day. For them, it is most important that a fragrance is reassuring and conjures up emotional memories

Preference: Function 

These customers’ fragrance choices are motivated by feeling clean and fresh. They choose lightweight fragrances that enable them to feel like they have just stepped out of the shower. For them, it is important that a fragrance is not cloying or overpowering. They don’t mind if it dissipates or wears off during the day."
Stage Two: Character,"This stage defines the product ranges that are most suited to the customer's behavioural traits. This step also determines which scent from each range of three to choose. The three factors are: Indulgent: Balanced : Giving These factors help us to identify the precise scent from each range to select for the customer, and also enable us to tell customers about their shopping habits.

Character: Indulgent 

For these customers, shopping is all about fun. Their engagement with retail is about activities that are rewarding and life- affirming. They are busy customers, but nevertheless appreciate the finer things in life. When they can, they like to give themselves treats - the argument always being because I deserve it'

Character: Balanced

Product that is local falls into this category. It's about being friendly and engaging, understanding community and appreciating the bigger picture. These consumers are naturally active, body-aware and careful about their wellbeing. They appreciate anything handmade, natural and organic, and what this represents.

Character: Giving

These customers are organised uncomplicated and outward-looking. Sharp, driven and focused, these customers are altruistic and aware concerned with the needs of others and sensitive to the environment. "
Stage Three: Mindset,"This third step determines how we address customers from this point forward with a better understanding of how they like to receive information and communication. The three choices are: Analytics, Expressive & Social.

Mindset: Analytical

Key factors here influencing design and tone of voice are the requirement to be factual, logical and detailed. For these customers, facts come first. They don't want fluff, but rather want to know what's inside the product. And they want that delivered in a manner that is clear, sensible and simple.

Mindset: Expressive

Here the product is defined and the customer influenced by the requirement to be cultural, authentic and romantic. These customers are very narrative-driven. They like to know the story behind stuff, and rant to find out who made . ex to did that magic eureka moment when they first discovered it.

Mindset: Social 

This category is defined by an understanding of networks and social media. It’s about being socially informed and knowing. These customers have a holistic approach and can combine both creative and the lateral. More connected than most, these customers are creative, collaborative connoisseurs who are into what is happening now. They want to know what their network is thinking, and to share what they are thinking too."
